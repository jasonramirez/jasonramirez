<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

<p>
  As a child of two artists and art professors, I feel 
  privileged to have grown up surrounded by creativity — 
  in galleries, museums, studios, and universities. Design 
  has always been the lens 
  through which I approach the world. Over time, that 
  foundation evolved into a career where I've led teams, 
  partnered with executives, and taken risks as an 
  entrepreneur — always balancing craft, systems, and people.
</p>

<p> 
  In my work, I've driven initiatives 
  that improved retention, clarified complex workflows, 
  and built trust at scale. Just as importantly, I've built 
  strong teams — scaling organizations, creating frameworks 
  that raised quality, and fostering cultures where designers 
  felt ownership and pride in their craft. For me, good design
  is the backbone of inclusive, user-centered, experiences
  and communication that create exceptional solutions
  and bring people together.
</p>

<p> 
  I'd love the chance to bring that mix of artistry, 
  experimentation, and people-centered leadership to 
  Airbnb and help evolve product design for the next chapter.
</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Jason Ramirez</p>
