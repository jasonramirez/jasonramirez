  <h1>Opening Context</h1>

  <p>
    When I share case studies, I like to be transparent about why I've chosen them. 
    This project is one I'm especially proud of because it
    demonstrates both complexity and scale.
    I chose this case study because it shows what a
    design-led initiative looks like during execution
    as well as executed and driving results.
  </p>

  <a name="business-problem"></a>
  <h1>The Business Problem</h1>

  <p>
    In February 2025, I sat down with our CTO,
    Alan Ni, and asked him where design
    could have the greatest impact at Grow Therapy.
    His answer was immediate:
    <em>"Help clients find the right providers on our marketplace."</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    That conversation drove me and the team to
    reveal the scale of the opportunity.
    We had built a large network of providers,
    but clients struggled to find a fit they could trust.
    Many never made it through the booking flow.
    Others churned after their first or second session.
    Every failed match was not only a business problem —
    wasted CAC and lost revenue — 
    but also a care problem.
    People came to us at vulnerable moments
    and too often they left without finding the support they needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alan also had a strong hunch:
    that improvements to UI and UX would directly influence outcomes.
    That insight became the spark for
    <strong>Marketplace Excellence</strong>,
    a multi-phase, multi-stream program that
    I led to improve client-provider matching.
  </p>

  <a name="research"></a>
  <h1>Digging Into Research and Data</h1>

  <p>
    The first step was to dig into everything we already knew. 
    I pulled together existing UXR, quantitative data, 
    and insights from teams across the company. 
    The data told a sobering story: 
    <span class="post__blurred-text">XX%</span> of clients who reached the booking page never completed it, 
    most often dropping out during insurance verification 
    or due to booking errors. 
    Exit surveys told us that availability was a big issue,
    <span class="post__blurred-text">XX%</span> of clients said it
    was hard to see and <span class="post__blurred-text">XX%</span>
    said they couldn't easily tell providers apart.
    Data analysis confirmed that the more profiles a client viewed,
    the more likely they were to convert and stay beyond their first two sessions.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make sense of this,
    I worked closely with IC PMs, the Growth team,
    Clinical Excellence, and my GPM partner Nirav.
    By combining these perspectives,
    we established a shared, cross-functional
    understanding of the problem. 
  </p>

  <a name="problems"></a>
  <h1>Problems Across the Funnel</h1>

  <p>
    Looking holistically,
    the problems were clear at every stage of the client journey.
    <span class="post__blurred-text">XX</span>% of clients dropped off on the booking page.
    Over <span class="post__blurred-text">XX</span>% were lukewarm
    about their provider even before intake.
    <span class="post__blurred-text">XX</span>% didn't stay with
    their initial provider after 30 days.
    And almost <span class="post__blurred-text">XX</span>% 
    dropped off entirely within their first month without ever finding another therapist.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was a leaky funnel in the truest sense.
    At every step, clients were losing confidence and slipping away.
  </p>

  <a name="strategy"></a>
  <h1>Crafting the Strategy</h1>

  <p>
    To move forward, I created a strategy using a 
    <strong>70/30 framework</strong>: 70% defined upfront, 
    30% left to evolve through testing and feedback. 
    Inspired by <em>Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</em>, 
    my process was straightforward but disciplined: 
    diagnose the problems, define guiding principles, 
    set actions, and make the sources of those decisions visible 
    so collaborators could trust the strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result was a roadmap split into three phases. 
    In the short term, we would reduce friction by 
    fixing booking errors and clarifying costs. 
    In the medium term, we would improve exploration 
    through better profiles, filters, and reviews. 
    And in the long term, we would codify the 
    harder-to-define aspects of therapeutic fit — 
    things like provider style, warmth, and trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't build this strategy alone. 
    It needed to be collaborative. I worked with IC designers, 
    PMs, and partners across the organization to pressure-test the approach,
    and then aligned it with leadership, including the CTO, VP of Product,
    and our GPM.

  <h1>From Audits to Experiments</h1>

  <p>
    With alignment secured, 
    the next step was to dig deeper into the specific problems. 
    Together with PMs and IC designers, 
    we conducted structured audits of search results, 
    filters, provider profiles, and booking flows. 
    These weren't just reviews — 
    they were detailed walkthroughs that turned vague problems 
    into actionable opportunities.

  <p>
    From these audits, 
    we built a repeatable pipeline: 
    identify friction, prioritize the opportunity, 
    and design experiments to test solutions. 
    This gave designers clarity on what to focus on 
    and gave executives confidence that we were solving the right problems.
  </p>

  <a name="workstreams"></a>
  <h1>Codifying the Workstreams</h1>

  <p>
    The audits gave us a clear backlog,
    which I codified into six workstreams:
    provider profiles, search information architecture,
    booking UX, general UX friction, client momentum, and search patterns.
    Each one addressed a different part of the client journey,
    but together they formed a cohesive plan.
  </p>

  <p>
    This wasn't just a design initiative anymore.
    With buy-in from the CTO on strategy,
    the VP of Product on prioritization,
    and Nirav on direction,
    Marketplace Excellence was 
    established on the roadmap for how we would evolve the marketplace.
  </p>

  <a name="phase-one"></a>
  <h1>Phase I: Short-Term Solutions</h1>

  <p>
    In Phase I, we tackled the most obvious friction points. 
    We developed a five-tier client decision-making framework, 
    which became the backbone of our search and profile redesigns. 
    We simplified booking by fixing error states and clarifying required inputs. 
    We shifted account creation earlier, 
    since clients without accounts were three times more likely to no-show. 
    And we redesigned filters to emphasize what mattered most: 
    insurance and availability.

      Yasmine and I developed a five-tier decision-making framework,

    These changes not only improved conversion
    but also established reusable patterns — like error-handling libraries — 
    that raised the baseline of product quality across the company.
  </p>

  <a name="qbr"></a>
  <h1>Midpoint Reporting: QBR</h1>

  <p>
    About halfway through, Nirav and I presented Marketplace Excellence
    at a Quarterly Business Review.
    The room included the CEO, CTO, CMO, VP of Product, 
    and other functional leaders.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that moment,
    design was positioned not just as a service 
    function but as a strategic driver.
    We shared early wins — 
    booking fixes, filter redesigns, new provider cards — 
    and articulated the four principles guiding the work: 
    reduce friction, empower decisions, 
    optimize retention, and make exploration engaging.
    With executive alignment, we continued with investment to expand into Phase II.
  </p>

  <a name="phase-two"></a>
  <h1>Phase II: Medium-Term Solutions</h1>

  <p>
    With support secured, we moved into deeper improvements. 
    We introduced recurring availability so clients could book with more confidence in continuity. 
    We added provider personality signals, like short video intros, to make providers more relatable. 
    We designed interventions to reduce provider cancellations, focusing especially on high-cancel cohorts. 
    And we leveraged new estimation tools to make cost clearer and more trustworthy.
  </p>

  <p>
    These weren't just incremental tweaks. 
    They addressed the core anxieties clients had expressed in research — 
    trust, continuity, cost, and confidence.

  <h1>Impact</h1>

  <p>
    Marketplace Excellence delivered measurable improvements.
    Booking abandonment dropped.
    Profile exploration and intakes went up.
    Clients were more likely to attend their first
    appointment and stay with their providers.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the business, this meant more efficient acquisition spend,
    higher retention, and greater client lifetime value.
    For clients, it meant better matches, more trust, and easier access to care.
    And for design, it cemented our role as a
    <strong>strategic partner driving growth.</strong>
  </p>

  <a name="team"></a>
  <h1>Upleveling the Design Team</h1>

  <p>
    Marketplace Excellence wasn't just about outcomes
    for clients and the business.
    It was also about raising the bar for the design team.
  </p>

  <p>
    I introduced new practices for concept testing,
    shifting from preference-based feedback to structured validation of value drivers.
    I trained the team in using AI tools to accelerate prototyping and broaden exploration.
    I codified frameworks for working with Sales, Data, Clinical Excellence, and Support,
    making design a stronger cross-functional partner.
    And I set up a scalable design review process that balanced speed with accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    This program not only delivered results but also
    left the team stronger, faster, and more influential than before.
  </p>

  <a name="closing"></a>
  <h1>Closing</h1>

  <p>
    Marketplace Excellence wasn't just about fixing a funnel.
    It was about making therapy more accessible for clients,
    creating efficiencies for the business,
    and proving that design could lead at the company level.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most importantly, it was a collaborative effort.
    None of this would have been possible without
    the brilliant PMs, Product Designers, Engineeringers, Researchers,
    Data Scientists, and Clinicians who
    collaborated with me along the way.
