  <h1>Background</h1>

  <p>
    When I was leading Product Design at Grow Therapy, the company identified 
    <strong>intersession engagement</strong> as one of the most important 
    strategic priorities. We knew that to deliver better care, to 
    support providers in getting paid for their time, and demonstrate 
    outcomes strong enough to maintain and expand insurance contracts, 
    we had to improve the quality of care in general. 
    We could do this by helping clients engaging in personal reflections,
    activities provided by providers,
    and parparing for their upcoming session by capturing
    important insights and topics.
    <em>between sessions</em>.
  </p>

  <a name="team"></a>
  <h1>The Team</h1>

  <p>
    To make this real, I led design for a group that included <strong>Janice</strong>, 
    a staff designer; <strong>Prabha</strong>, a staff PM; and later, <strong>Sofia</strong>, 
    another designer who I pulled in for a specific strategy challenge. 
    On the product side, <strong>Mayuri</strong> was my key partner and 
    responsible for product side. My role as design leader became to 
    set the ambition, coach the designers and product managers to think 
    beyond narrow framing, and to secure executive alignment so the work 
    could land as a core company initiative.
  </p>

  <h1>The Process</h1>

  <h2>Recognizing Limited Ambition</h2>

  <p>
    The team's initial concept for <em>Session Topics</em> was tidy but small: 
    twelve to twenty-four hours before a session, clients would get a prompt asking what 
    they wanted to discuss in their upcoming session. They could enter up to five short topics, 
    each maxed our at 75 characters to prevent overwhelming clients with too many options.
    Eventyally, the client would be asled to share their topics with their provider. 
    Here is the initial concept:

    When I reviewed this, I observed that the 
    <strong>solution space was centered around logistig; helping people who
    already refleced take their notes and make them easily accessible to their
    therapist.</strong>. 
    It solved for the easy case — clients who already reflected and took notes — 
    but not for the majority of clients who struggled most with reflection. 
    It ignored the people who froze when prompted, 
    who felt inhibited bringing up sensitive issues, 
    or who simply didn't have the habit of reflecting at all.
    I believe the problem they were solving for was an optimziation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I aligned with a Group PM, and together we agreed that the scope had to expand. 
    I took the lead and prompted the team to reframe their problem. I gave them
    some general direction to get them started:
    <em>How might we help people who don't know how to reflect? 
    How might we support those who don't have the habit of reflection?</em> 
    This reframing process eventually generated a much richer set of problem statements — 
    ones that were both more ambitious and more customer-centered.
  </p>

  <h2>Driving Exploration</h2>

  <p>
    Once the team had reframed the problems, They were able to break out of
    incremental solutioning. I worked directly with Janice during 
    the <strong>solution exploration </strong> phase to continue to keep 
    Janice a little more high level. Janice and Prabha would study 
    competitors for patterns in reflection and preparation, 
    to use AI tools like ChatGPT and Subframe to generate divergent ideas 
    and prototype and test with customers to validate not just 
    <em>whether</em> clients forgot topics, but <em>why reflection was 
    difficult in the first place</em> and what about these ideas
    worked for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This push reframed the work and opened up a much more ambitious set of concepts.
    The team began exploring guided prompts pulled from past session 
    transcripts to help clients "pick up where they left off." 
    They tested visual reflection tools that allowed people to 
    sketch or draw instead of writing. They built guided categories 
    like <em>"Celebrate" → "a win at work"</em> or <em>"an 
    improvement in my relationship.
    "</em> They considered continuity prompts that nudged clients to build 
    on prior reflections rather than starting from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    By forcing the team to experiment with new methods and approaches, 
    I helped shift Session Topics from a narrow note-sharing tool into a
     set of solutions that addressed the needs of clients 
     who struggled to reflect as a habit.

  <h2>Championing Innovation (and Practicing Pragmatism)</h2>

  <p>
    One of the most ambitious directions I personally championed was 
    <strong>audio-first reflection</strong>. From our recent 
    acquisition of Summit (a life coach startup) I had learned 
    that their most engaged clients weren't the ones who chatted 
    with their AI life coach — they were the ones who spoke to it. 
    This supported my own hypothesis that reading and typing 
    text while reflecting inhibited free-flow expression, 
    whereas voice would unlock more authentic, natural reflection.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't leave this at gut instinct. I used 
    <strong>ChatGPT's Deep Research feature</strong> 
    and worked with my research partner Hannah to gather 
    evidence from external sources on how conversational 
    AI — particularly voice — could transform engagement. 
    I then brought this evidence to our Group PM and our CTO, 
    positioning audio-first not just as a feature idea, 
    but as a <strong>strategic differentiator</strong> 
    that could elevate Session Topics into something 
    uniquely valuable.
  </p>

</div>

<article class="content content--reading post">
  <p>
    The CTO ultimately pushed back, arguing that testing audio 
    was expensive and wouldn't sway our decision to experiment
    with audio in general on a mobile app - he didn't field
    that experimenting now would yield insights relevant
    enough to justify the investment. 
    I disagreed, but I also knew when to adapt. 
    I committed to punting the standalone experiment 
    while continuing to push for audio-first reflection
    as part of the
    <strong>mobile app roadmap</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This moment highlighted two aspects of my leadership: 
    my ability to <strong>champion innovation and scope 
    expansion</strong>, pushing Session Topics 
    beyond incremental improvements, 
    and my ability to <strong>practice pragmatism a
    nd alignment</strong>, showing that even when I disagreed, 
    I could commit to the organizational decision while preserving 
    the long-term vision. It was a win: 
    I broadened the scope of what Session Topics could mean strategically, 
    introduced evidence-backed innovation, 
    and kept the door open for future implementation.
  </p>

  <h2>Guiding Execution</h2>

  <p>
    As we continued toward the launch, 
    I worked closely with the team through multiple design reviews,
    alignment presentations, and design reviews.
    We iterated, refining both the 
    client experience and the provider workflow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two interventions stand out:
  </p>

  <strong>AI Summarization</strong>
  <p>Rather than 
    limiting clients to short notes, 
    and focusing on people who already have the habit of reflection, 
    I pushed for open 
    reflections that we could then summarize with 
    AI into discrete topics. Providers now received 
    actionable summaries without being overwhelmed by raw text.</p>
  
  <strong>Dynamic Prompting Strategy</strong>
  <p>
    The team's original plan was to prompt clients 
    exactly twenty-four hours before a session. 
    I asked Janice to collaborate with Sofia to 
    rethink the strategy around the real client journey: 
    how long between selecting a therapist and their 
    first session, how long between recurring sessions, 
    and how to avoid fatigue by reducing prompts when a 
    client had already reflected. 
    This produced a smarter, 
    more contextual prompting system that 
    meaningfully improved engagement.</p>
  </ul>

    The version of Session Topics we
    launched as a standalone experience. 
    Clients could reflect openly, their 
    responses were summarized by AI into topics, 
    and providers received concise preparation material. 
    It was simple, but it expanded the ambition: 
    it turned raw client thoughts into structured, 
    actionable conversation starters, and it did so in a way 
    that aligned with both providers and clients.

  <h1>The Impact</h1>

  <p>
    The launch seemed a success. 
    Clients engaged and providers valued 
    the clarity of AI-generated topics, 
    and most importantly, the initiative demonstrated that 
    <strong>intersession engagement was not only possible b
    ut powerful</strong>. It can advance care quality, 
    support providers, and create measurable outcomes 
    that Grow will be able to use to strengthen its 
    insurance partnerships.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also set a precedent. Session Topics will be the first 
    step to the proving ground that will validate intersession 
    engagement as a 
    <strong>pillar of Grow Therapy's product vision</strong>, 
    influencing how Grow will design the mobile app and 
    evolve their long-term Technical strategy.
  </p>

  <a name="reflection"></a>
  <h1>Reflection</h1>

  <p>
    This project was never just about a feature. 
    It was about recognizing when ambition was too small, 
    aligning with leadership to expand scope, 
    coaching a team into deeper exploration, 
    and pushing for bold, innovative ideas backed by evidence. 
    It was about navigating strategic pivots, 
    practicing pragmatism when needed, and still delivering impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, Session Topics was a demonstration of
    design leadership at its fullest: setting strategy, c
    hampioning innovation, securing executive alignment, 
    and raising the bar for my team. 
    It showed how design can shape not just the product, 
    but the company's direction.
