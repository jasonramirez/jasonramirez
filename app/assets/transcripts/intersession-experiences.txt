At Grow Therapy, one of our company-level goals was to improve intersession engagement — helping clients reflect between sessions, supporting providers, and demonstrating outcomes to insurers. At the time, our product focused narrowly on logistics like scheduling, and I had strong conviction that this was too limited. I pushed with our CTO and VP of Product that intersession engagement had to become the core value proposition of our mobile app and care strategy.

The team’s first pass at Session Topics was small: twelve hours before a session, clients could enter up to five short topics to share with their provider. When I reviewed this, I recognized immediately that the problem space was too narrow. It solved for clients who already reflected, not for the majority who struggled. I aligned with a Group PM, and together we reframed the problem: How do we help people who don’t know how to reflect at all?

I then pushed the team into broader exploration frameworks: competitor analysis, using AI tools like ChatGPT and Subframe to generate ideas, and concept testing to understand why reflection was difficult. That produced new directions: guided prompts pulled from past session transcripts, sketching instead of writing, guided categories like Celebrate, and continuity prompts. I also personally championed an audio-first approach, backed by evidence from our Summit acquisition and ChatGPT’s Deep Research. While the CTO pushed back on a standalone experiment, I ensured voice remained on the roadmap — an example of both championing innovation and practicing pragmatism.

Through pivots — first folded into the mobile app, later spun back out — I guided the team through design reviews, coaching them on strategy and execution. Two interventions stand out: enabling open reflections that AI summarized into provider-ready topics, and redesigning the prompting strategy around real client journeys instead of blunt reminders.

When we launched Session Topics, engagement was high. Clients consistently reflected, providers valued the summaries, and we demonstrated intersession engagement as a pillar of Grow’s product vision. For me, it was a clear example of design leadership: diagnosing small ambition, expanding scope, navigating pivots, and delivering a solution that shaped company strategy.
