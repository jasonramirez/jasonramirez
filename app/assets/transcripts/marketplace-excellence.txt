About 9 months into my time at Grow, the CTO told me design could have the greatest impact by helping clients find the right providers. That conversation sparked Marketplace Excellence, a multi-phased strategic program I created to solve a significant challenge and opportunity: client-provider matching. Our marketplace had thousands of providers, but clients struggled to find good fits and often dropped off before booking or churned after a few sessions.

I started with evidence-based audits that revealed shocking numbers: 85% of clients who clicked "book" failed to complete, and 85% left search results without clicking a profile. Armed with this data, I built systematic workstreams across booking UX, provider profiles, reviews, and filtering. I introduced AI-powered profile quality improvements and reduced provider cancellations. Along the way, I up leveled the design team with AI enablement and cross-functional partnerships.

The result? Marketplace Excellence repositioned design as a strategic driver at Grow, improving conversion, retention, and trust while creating repeatable systems that scaled beyond the program. It proved that design could operate as a force multiplier for the entire business.
