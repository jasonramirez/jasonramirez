# Setting Up An Experiment

A lean experiment might follow this path:

* Identify your assumption
* Write your hypothesis
* identify the customer behavior associated with that assumption
* commit to a single metric you believe in
* design a solution

## Identify Your Assumption

==Look for an assumption you are making about a key-stone element of your
product that is accepted as true without evidence.== An assumption can take form
as a belief about your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a
projection about market size, and many other things.

Generally it is best to ==start with the riskiest assumptions - the ones that if
are invalidated, this product might suffer.== Some helpful ways to uncover
assumptions are to look at universal risks, use your intuition, or talk with
domain experts

## Uncover the Customer Behavior
How does your riskiest assumption relate to your customer’s behavior? For
instance, let’s pretend that your riskiest assumption is that your customers
will trust your service with their personal information. The behavior will be
the customer giving you their personal information. The best way to move forward
with this, is to push for a real “currency” exchange and get the customer
complete the action.

## Target Metric
Commit to a minimum success threshold. Choose a number high enough to get you
and your team excited if true and relative to the assumption you are testing.

## Solution
Build the absolute minimum required to test your assumption, as fast as
possible. Don’t just confirm, learn. Include ways to capture surprises as well
as real behavior important to validating your business activity is successful in
influencing customer behavior.

## Hypothesis
A specific description of the customer behavior you’re measuring, your target
metric and the experiment you’re running to test your assumption. If we do X,
then Y% of customers will behave in way Z.

If you are running many experiments it can be a good idea to create a visual map
of those experiments so your team can be aware of the progress you are making
