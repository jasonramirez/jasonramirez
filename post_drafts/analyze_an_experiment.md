observations, add your insights, and make a decision to kill, persevere, or
pivot. 

Results
What actually happened? Record the actual metrics generated during your

Observations
Why did the customer behave this way? Record the observable behavior, live
feedback and reactions you witnessed firsthand, which influenced the actual
results.

Insights

observations made in the field.

Decision
Was your riskiest assumption true? Look for a trend in your evidence over time.
No single experiment holds all the answers. Iterate? Persevere? Pivot?
