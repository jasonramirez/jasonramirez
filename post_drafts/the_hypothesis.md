# The Hypothesis

The guiding light to a good experiment is the hypothesis. It is the second
step to setting up an experiment, right after establishing your risky
assumption.  ==If you can't articulate a hypothesis, then you don't
have an experiment.==

==The most straightforward and clear way to write a hypothesis is the
_if_ / _then_ format.== Let's break it down.

## If

==The **if** is an isolated change in the application that will lead to
a desired behavior or outcome and should be coupled with your
assumption.==  It can be as simple as better feedback, or as complex as
adding a feature. I try to write these as solutions. From there, you should be
able to infer the desire or needs of the user - or better yet, a problem they
are facing.

Good examples:

* If we add a success message after...

* If users can chat with one-another in the application...

* If users can challenge one another...

* If there is transparency in who is rating the products...

Bad examples:

* If we add hundreds of new products...

* If we make our app responsive and remove the landing page...

## Then

==The **then** is focused on our desired behavior or outcome and
should be measurable.== Avoid desired outcomes that deal with
emotion. Although you _could_ measure how happy a person is, it is generally
difficult to rely on.

Good examples:

* Then we will get more _sign ups_.

* Then users will _share_ the app with eachother.

* Then more users will participate in the forum.

Bad examples:

* Then the users will have more fun.

* Then the users wont be so annoyed.

## Summary

==A well written hypothesis should help you understand from a high level how you
are going to add value to the user, and how adding that value is going to
result in a desired and measurable outcome.==
