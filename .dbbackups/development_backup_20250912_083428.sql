20	1	Absolutely, I do have a framework for managing senior designers who may be underperforming. One effective approach I've used is to combine structured feedback with empathetic support. It starts with having open conversations to understand their perspective and motivations, which helps in aligning expectations.

51	1	Absolutely! Building on what we discussed earlier, I recommend using the "[Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact](/posts/turning-a-team-framework-into-company-wide-impact)" approach. Start by codifying successful strategies your team has used and socialize them with other teams. By showcasing real examples and getting cross-functional buy-in, you can help your design team gain a strategic voice and align on impactful initiatives. This way, you’ll shift from being a service provider to becoming a key player in shaping the overall strategy. Embracing this kind of structured approach can really elevate your role as a designer.	answer	\N	{"knowledge_base_influence": {"sources": [{"id": 426, "tags": "#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks",

53	1	Starting from scratch with your team's strategy can feel daunting, especially if past efforts haven't been successful. I recommend utilizing the "[Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact](/posts/turning-a-team-framework-into-company-wide-impact)" approach, where you first identify what has or hasn't worked before. Engage your team in a collaborative effort to define clear goals and document your processes, ensuring everyone is aligned on expectations. This can create a shared sense of purpose and help build momentum moving forward. Embracing this [structured approach](/posts/running-an-experiment) can lead to more impactful outcomes.	answer	\N	{"user_feedback": {"rating": "thumbs_down", "user_id": 1, "submitted_at":

5	420	==The [design sprint] is a tool to identify the biggest potential risk in your product and to design a solution around it.== As a fan of the Google Ventures sprint model, I wanted to share a somewhat detailed summary of one of the first steps: the sprint map. The Sprint Map The sprint map should be done on the first day. ==This map will be your guiding light throughout the sprint process. It will help keep you on topic and your idea focused on the part of your product where you can make the biggest difference.== As an added benefit, the construction of the map will get the entire team thinking together and committed to the process. What you need: 1 hour A sprint facilitator The dedicated attention of the sprint team Whiteboard Whiteboard markers How to draw the map: The facilitator is responsible for collecting the teams thoughts on the whiteboard.	0	size	Design Sprint Map for Heroes (Part 1)	Blog Post	#process	0.9	post_6	2023-07-14 18:04:45.111303	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.843452	2025-09-12 05:08:49.843452

They should try their best to avoid interpreting the team's thoughts, but if and when they do, they should be sure to ask the team "does this look right?". ==It is important that the facilitator makes sure that the team's thoughts are captured, and the result is not just the interpretation or ideas of the facilitator.== As the facilitator stands at the whiteboard, they should help the team through the steps of creating the map: Left to right On the far left side of the whiteboard, list the characters that will be most prominent in this story. ==I try to think of the map as the quest of a hero. There is the hero with a goal, and all of the integral characters they meet along the way.== Sometimes the story can break into side stories of the supporting characters, but in the end it revolves around our hero.

7	420	in the end it revolves around our hero. Jot down the characters on the left starting with the hero. Write who they will meet along their journey in stack formation (in order top to bottom) to complete their goal. Typically there are 2-4 characters. Example: !design sprint map: step 1 Far right The far right is the goal of our hero. ==The end goal is the something that our hero is trying to attain. It is usually something tangible or service oriented.== For instance: the hero wants a meal, a bicycle route, a recommendation for the best seats at the opera. The more concise this is, the easier the map will be to create (and to be honest, the entire product). Example: !design sprint map: step 2 Map the journey The final step is to map all of the happenings between the hero and the goal.

It's a robust prompt — and it came in the form a a blind app review focused on the creative conception of a product. I love it. A big part of being a designer is being able to give critical feedback and recognize areas for improvement. I wanted to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. My goal was to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can help create a better product.

9	421	If you are building an app with limited time and money, experiments are a necessity. ==It is invaluable to learn what works, and what doesn't, before you invest time and money into an idea.== It's true that some people get it correct the first time. But, that is rare and risky to assume that you got it correct too. Running experiments helps you gain confidence that you are creating a _correct_ solution. In this post, I will outline the components of a Lean experiment. ==I use Lean experiments because they emphasize spending the least amount of time to build a testable solution.== Setting Up a Lean Experiment A Lean experiment follows a straightforward path: Establish your riskiest assumption Identify the customer behavior associated with that assumption Commit to a single metric you believe in Design a solution Capture your hypothesis Build the minimum viable feature/product Document the results Record your observations Add your insights Let's go more into detail about each part of a	0	size	Running a Lean Experiment (Part 1)	Blog Post	#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks	0.9	post_13	2023-07-14 18:02:53.805307	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.864683	2025-09-12 05:08:49.864683

Identify the Riskiest Assumption The riskiest assumption is an assumption you are making about a key-stone element of your product. You accept it as true without evidence. ==It can take form as a belief about your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about market size, and many other things.== It is best to start with the riskiest assumptions first. If we don't address this assumption, this business idea might fail. The riskiest assumption is not easy to find [1]. When trying to find your riskiest assumption, start with universal risks. Be sure to use your intuition and challenge your own assumptions. Follow up by talking with domain experts. The Customer's Action How does your riskiest assumption relate to your customer’s actions? Let’s pretend that your riskiest assumption is "customers will trust your service with their personal information".	1	size	Running a Lean Experiment (Part 2)	Blog Post	#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks	0.9	post_13	2023-07-14 18:02:53.805307	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.868016	2025-09-12 05:08:49.868016
11	421	hat your riskiest assumption is "customers will trust your service with their personal information". The related action is the customer giving you their personal information. When creating a Lean experiment, you want to identify an action that you can test and measure. Some examples: Choses option a over b Pays you for the product Signs up for a newsletter Comes back to the application the next day Refers a friend The best types of actions are real “currency” exchanges. This is when a person give you something of value to them. It demonstrates a high level of honesty in their action. ==The more currency that the person has to spend to complete this action, the more value we can associate with that action.== Target Metric Commit to a minimum success threshold. Choose a number high enough to get you and your team excited if true and relative to the assumption you are testing.

Record the new information you generated during this experiment, as well as unique observations made in the field. Decision Was your riskiest assumption true? Look for a trend in your evidence over time. No single experiment holds all the answers. Iterate? Persevere? Pivot? If you are running many experiments it can be a good idea to create a visual map of those experiments so your team can be aware of the progress you are making [2]. Summary Remember, there is no perfect solution, but there are certainly ones that are better than others. Don't assume that you got it right. Assume that you don't know, but the people using your application will tell and show you what "right" feels like. --- Endnotes [1] https://leanstack.com/on-identifying-riskiest-assumptions/ [2] http://www.movestheneedle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rapid_Experiment_Map.pdf	4	size	Running a Lean Experiment (Part 5)	Blog Post	#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks	0.9	post_13	2023-07-14 18:02:53.805307	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.890121	2025-09-12 05:08:49.890121
14	422	==Running out of money or time can force a product team into making difficult decisions about the future of their product. The two most challenging decisions: pivot the product or kill it altogether.== To be presented with a challenging decision like this isn't rare; it might happen many times during the life of a product. At the earliest stages of a product, when the risk of running out of resources is greatest, it's important to be very critical of your path and ask yourself if you should kill, pivot or persevere every couple weeks. Typically, the first time you encounter this question, you will rely on the qualitative data from customer development. As your product grows, and you have more users, you can rely on both qualitative and quantitative data such as pirate metrics. It is very easy to always preserve, but it isn't always the best decision.	0	size	Kill, Pivot or Preserve (Part 1)	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_14	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.900266	2025-09-12 05:08:49.900266

When to Kill The hardest decisions to make about your product is to kill it. I would love to say that a product should be killed when the team has tried everything without success, but that isn't the case. Resources will run out before you can try everything. ==If you can save your resources for a project that has more promise, you probably should.== A few questions you can ask yourself before you decide to kill the project: Do you have a continued passion for your product or vision? Can you identify exactly why your product is failing?	1	size	Kill, Pivot or Preserve (Part 2)	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_14	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.915087	2025-09-12 05:08:49.915087

Are there seeing signs of success in the future? Are there obvious pivot options that you haven't tried? Do you have enough runway (time, money, resources) to try a pivot? Will you be devastated if you kill your product? If you answered no to more than one of those questions, this product may be ready for the shelf. But obviously, even if you did answer all of those questions with a no, you might be able to justify continuing on. Don't let a stinkin' blog post sink your ship ;) When to Pivot There are many types of pivots that you can make if your product isn't succeeding. Assuming that you are not feeling enough success to continue on the same path, here are some questions you can ask yourself before deciding to pivot: Are there particular parts of your product that are being used far more than others?	2	size	Kill, Pivot or Preserve (Part 3)	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_14	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.91834	2025-09-12 05:08:49.91834

Is there a particular customer segment that has responded better than others? Are there new channels to your customers that you haven't tried? Have you tried changing the pricing? The way you are selling your product? I.e. subscription, a la carte, etc? Have you tried focusing on different growth model? Paid, viral, referral etc? When to Preserve It is easy to choose to preserve, but it isn't always the right answer. Before you decide that you don't need to make any major changes to your products path, try asking yourself a few questions: Do you still have a passion for the vision of the product? Is the product currently meeting your goals? Is the product sustainable at this pace? If the product continues at this pace, will it exceed your goals? Do you have to defend the product to anyone on your team?	3	size	Kill, Pivot or Preserve (Part 4)	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_14	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.921305	2025-09-12 05:08:49.921305

This is when the product is at the greatest risk of running out of money, time or resources. The meeting generally involves the presenter, the stakeholders and anyone that can help to answer questions about the data in the presentation. ==The presenter, often the founder, presents a quick summary of the last 2 weeks, then makes a recommendation to the stakeholders to kill, pivot or preserve. The stakeholders often ask questions, and then vote for or against the recommendation.== Often, you get a consensus, but if that isn't possible, you follow the majority vote or the stakeholder with the largest stake.

The Presentation I usually create the presentation the day before or day of the meeting. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes to create. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be clear and consistent. It is a great tool to look back and see what you have tried and what you have learned. The presentations can be difficult to compile. When I sit down to start creating the presentation, I often think to myself "what did we do the last 2 weeks?" ==As I begin to prepare the presentation I am almost always wowed by what we have learned and accomplished.== My presentations are anywhere from 5 - 10 pages, and take about 10 minutes to present.	5	size	Kill, Pivot or Preserve (Part 6)	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_14	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.927295	2025-09-12 05:08:49.927295

21	423	Before you start building the world’s most awesome app, it’s a good idea to find out if people want it. I know it’s hard to believe others might not love your idea, but unfortunately, not everybody likes the same stuff. If we find out others have interest, you can avoid wasting time and money building something nobody wants. The Facebook ads experiment will give you a high-level understanding around the following: if you have a strong unique value proposition if people desire to learn more about your idea, and which audience cares the most about it This experiment will not give you proof - this experiment will give you confidence. Wouldn't it be nice to have confidence that someone other than your best friend likes your idea? The Experiment The Facebook ads experiment leverages Facebook’s large and diverse user base and its rich data about those users.

Each ad has a design that highlights the unique value proposition and targets a specific audience. In each experiment, you isolate a variable to uncover which one garners interest. Those variables could be the unique value proposition, design, or audience. Getting set up In order to run this experiment you will need a few things: An idea for an app. At least one Unique Value Proposition (UVP) - it’s okay to have more than one. A well-defined audience that will be using your app. A Facebook account _Optional but highly recommended: Facebook page *_ _Optional but highly recommended: Splash page _  If you want your ad to appear in the Facebooks users’ news feeds, you will need a Facebook page and a website.

If you do create the splash page, you could incorporate a currency exchange. This would allow people to pay or sign up to be on a waiting list. Here is an example of a somewhat in-depth splash page to test a currency exchange http://www.nillyapp.com/  Running the ads To run the ads, visit https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads. You will need to log into your Facebook account to create the ads. I won’t go into great detail about how to do actually create the ads since the UI changes so often, but I will cover the main points. Ad Type Ideally, you want an ad that is meant to generate leads. You could create an ad that drives people to a Facebook page, but you wouldn’t benefit from the possible currency exchange of a splash page.

Audience &amp; Placements Chose an audience that is narrow. A large vague audience makes it more difficult to determine who is interested in your idea. You have the option to run ads just on Facebook, on Instagram, or on their entire ad network. If you believe that one of those areas doesn’t apply to you, then feel free to cut it out. Just make sure that you are consistent with all the ads. Budget &amp; Schedule Each ad should run for at least 7 days. I tend to spend about $100 to start. It's really up to you. Design &amp; Content Design and content encompass the format, media, page, and links. You will want to create a simple ad that shows your UVP and has a call to action.

Determining success Bare in mind that these A/B test will return a single data point for you to compare results - clicks per impressions. You have to determine what success looks like. Different ideas should have different thresholds. If your idea is hard to execute and you need many users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be very high. If your idea is easy to execute and needs a few users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be low. Try to answer these questions to determine a success threshold: How difficult do you think it will be to execute on your idea? How many users do you think you will need to be successful? How much competition is there for your idea?	4	size	Validation with Facebook Ads  (Part 5)	Blog Post	#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks	0.9	post_16	2023-07-14 18:02:28.613096	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.942778	2025-09-12 05:08:49.942778

You can throw words like “free” and “limited time” that will encourage clicks, but we don’t want that. We want an ad that tests only the value of your idea and the audiences that see it.

If one ad got way more clicks per impressions than the other, you could be concerned that the unique value proposition isn’t strong enough and that the ads visual style is what garnered the clicks. You should run a UVP A/B test to isolate the style as the enticing factor. If neither ad gets enough clicks to make you happy, you should run this test again with a different UVP. Value proposition with value proposition variable This test is to help us identify the interest of our unique value proposition. Unlike the solo UPV a/b test, here we are going to pit two UVPs against each other. This test is great to run when you have competing ideas, or when you are not sure which aspect of your idea people are most interested in. When creating this ad, make sure that the ad is simple and focuses mostly on the unique value proposition.	7	size	Validation with Facebook Ads  (Part 8)	Blog Post	#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks	0.9	post_16	2023-07-14 18:02:28.613096	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.951344	2025-09-12 05:08:49.951344

You've talked to 10 people who also feel the same way, and would love an emoji-cupcake delivery service. During your conversations with them, you also uncovered a new problem. Of those who ordered emoji-cupcakes in the past, the ordering process is complex and the variety limiting. You're feeling pretty good about this, and you want some more validation.

Some suggestions: emoji-cupcake, emoji-cookie, emoji-cupcake delivery, cupcake delivery. Once you have those, check out how they fair using the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool. Analyzing the results After you run the query, you will get results that contain your keywords and related search phrases. You can use this to draw some high-level conclusions.

If nobody is using your search phrases or similar search phrases, then there probably isn't much demand for the idea. Like most of these early-stage experiments, you have to determine the success threshold. Do 10k searches per month make you feel like there is a market for what you are selling? 100k? 1 million? Suggested Bid We can hypothesize that if a suggested bid is high, then a person is willing to pay for that solution/product. The idea is that advertisers are willing to pay for these ads at this high price, so they must be worth to warrant the expense. Combine this with the search volume for more insight. A high volume and high suggested bid could mean that there is a lot of people searching for a solution, and a lot of people willing to pay for it. Specificity The number of words in the search phrase can also be insightful.

As Eric Reis put it "a pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision." There are many different types of pivots. Some, such as a marketing pivot or channel pivot, don't involve changing your product. Others can be as drastic as stripping away all the things that aren't working, and zooming-in on only the most important feature. Here is a short list of some different pivots to get your brain flowing: &gt;A pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision. &gt;Eric Reis Customer need pivot In some cases, early on your customers might show little interest in the problem you are solving. This pivot is about rethinking the value of the problem you are solving. Perhaps it's time to solve a different problem with a completely new product. One of the most popular customer need pivots is Groupon.	0	size	Ways To Pivot A Product (Part 1)	Blog Post	#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks	0.9	post_21	2023-07-12 18:50:22.978948	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.985178	2025-09-12 05:08:49.985178

You've probably never heard of the website "The Point": a social good fundraising site that employed the _tipping point system_ to secure funding. When enough people promised a pledge, the funding would be secured - kind of like Kickstarter. It didn't catch on. The founder decided to pivot to a different customer need using the same concept of the _tipping point_. The Point became Groupon. A site where groups of people could hit a tipping point that would open up coupons for use. Zoom-in pivot Do you have at least one great feature? Take only the most successful feature (most used? highest grossing?) and strip away anything that isn't necessary for the success of that feature.

As the company grew, they expanded what they produced, including rubber goods, electronics, and telecommunications devices. In 1992, they zoomed-in and decided to focus exclusively on their mobile devices. They sold off all other divisions of their company and rose to great success (albeit unmaintainable...) Zoom-out pivot If you have an extremely focused product and simple feature set, perhaps it's time to think about expanding into new areas and solving other problems. Dig into your customer and see if they are using your product as a compliment to other software or tools. If so, think about solving for some of the problems that those other tools solve. A great example of the zoom-out pivot is PayPal.

It took a lot of permutations, and the merger with a financial services company, before PayPal became a payments platform. Quickly thereafter, they became the preferred online payment system for eBay and rose to glory. Customer segment pivot Perhaps your product solves an actual problem, but the customers who you've been targeting don't appreciate it the way you'd hoped they would. Was there another audience that hinted at the value of your product, but it wasn't for them? Perhaps now is a good time to try and position and optimize your product for a more appreciative segment.

Do Consider Are you comfortable making decisions that directly affect people's lives? The role of a manager varies, but one thing is clear: your decisions directly impact people's lives. You decide which projects they'll work on, their salary, and even their employment status. Of course being a manager has its joys: helping people develop new skills, setting them up for success, and creating opportunities are just part of the fun. However, being a manager also means making tough decisions and giving feedback.	1	size	Manager or Individual Contributor  (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management	0.9	post_27	2023-07-13 02:12:33.50214	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:49.999241	2025-09-12 05:08:49.999241
48	427	ust part of the fun. However, being a manager also means making tough decisions and giving feedback. A good manager is emotionally available, able to handle difficult situations, resolve conflicts, and address issues face-to-face. If you're uncomfortable telling someone they're not performing well, reassigning them from a beloved project, or in the extreme letting them go, then being a manager may not be for you. While I don't want to focus solely on the challenges, it's important to recognize that you can't be a good manager if you're not willing to make decisions that directly affect people's lives. Do Not Consider Do you love using your technical skills? Many people claim that as a manager, you no longer need to use your technical design skills. However, it's not about using the same skills, but rather leveraging your expertise and applying your technical abilities to new areas of responsibility. Don't think of switching tracks as a waste of your acquired skills.	2	size	Manager or Individual Contributor  (Part 3)	Blog Post	#management	0.9	post_27	2023-07-13 02:12:33.50214	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.001899	2025-09-12 05:08:50.001899
49	427	to new areas of responsibility. Don't think of switching tracks as a waste of your acquired skills. If someone tells you that you're wasting your skills, they're only looking at the outcomes you've delivered, not considering your true potential. Moreover, if you feel that you lack the technical skills to progress in your current track, take a moment to reflect. Are you experiencing imposter syndrome, lacking motivation, or simply not ready to invest in your career? It's alright if you're not prepared to develop new skills in your current path. However, if that's the case, now may not be the right time to explore a new track. First, ensure that you understand what is inhibiting your desire to invest in yourself. Simply changing tracks isn't always reliable inspiration.

51	428	The Challenge In January 2023, our design organization went through a reorg. I was leading design across 4 groups with 12 squads, supported by two managers and two senior architects. 30% of the people had joined Dropbox in the last 6 months. When I stepped back to evaluate the work, I saw issues: experiences below our quality bar, duplicative bespoke patterns, and overly designed solutions. With so many new folks learning unfamiliar surfaces, I knew the problem would only compound. My task was clear: raise the quality of solutions—without slowing the team down. The Approach We already had processes documented, and our managers were empowered to lead. So I made a conscious choice: instead of micromanaging execution, I would focus specifically on solution quality. I aligned with the managers and senior ICs to define a “quality standard” for the team. The philosophy was simple: if leadership is calibrated, we can scale feedback consistently across all squads.	0	size	Raising the Bar Without Slowing Down  (Part 1)	Blog Post	#process, #quality, #leadership	0.9	post_72	2025-09-04 04:40:11.551941	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.00923	2025-09-12 05:08:50.00923
52	428	sophy was simple: if leadership is calibrated, we can scale feedback consistently across all squads. To reinforce the standard, we added rituals: critiques followed by leadership calibrations, a living document to capture overlapping experiences and conflicts, and plans of action that made design intent transparent and ROI-driven. We also introduced velocity tracking to ensure that our focus on quality didn’t come at the cost of speed. What Changed The results came quickly. Teams began to identify quality issues themselves, cutting down on bespoke one-offs and increasing cohesion across experiences. Designers leaned into usability testing, negative feedback dropped, and velocity actually increased. Pattern cohesion improved, connectivity across experiences strengthened, and the overall quality bar rose noticeably. Most importantly, it wasn’t me alone setting the bar—it was the managers and senior ICs pushing for specific changes and scaling that expectation across their squads.	1	size	Raising the Bar Without Slowing Down  (Part 2)	Blog Post	#process, #quality, #leadership	0.9	post_72	2025-09-04 04:40:11.551941	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.011504	2025-09-12 05:08:50.011504

But I've learned a few things along the way—usually the hard way—that might be helpful to share. Coaching Scales Coaching creates more leaders, while dictating only creates followers. Early in my time at thoughtbot, I was given the chance to work with the Mayo Clinic. They were a powerful, detail-oriented, impactful organization. But they lacked the tech muscles—things like design thinking, agility, lean principles—that we now take for granted. As a leader, my instinct was to prove my value by demonstrating expertise. I brought in processes like the Google Ventures Design Sprint and introduced ways to validate ideas quickly. But it didn’t take long to realize I had no place being a domain expert in that room. The Mayo team had decades of medical expertise; I had deep knowledge of tech.

When I asked why, they admitted it was because they felt overshadowed—I was trying to play both the medical and tech expert, leaving them unsure of their role. That was my turning point. I had to stop leading by example and start leading by coaching. I shifted my approach: instead of positioning myself as the voice of tech, I asked my design partner to co-facilitate the sprint. Each evening we’d run a short retrospective using a simple framework: What’s the goal? What did you try that worked? What didn’t work? What will you try differently tomorrow? By giving them the space to lead and coaching them through the process, I wasn’t just solving the problem in front of us—I was building their capability to run design sprints long after this project ended.	1	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.018965	2025-09-12 05:08:50.018965

Setting strategy is more than understanding the product and the needs. It's setting up the team to be able to execute on the strategy by empowering through clarity. I learned this lesson while leading a project at Dropbox to rework the admin control panel. My boss had asked me to explore the area and come up with a strategy for long-term impact. I believed I was setting this up for success. I broke the work into parts—exploration, opportunity sizing, vision development—and passed it to a senior architect I trusted to lead the charge. But here’s where I failed: I didn’t wrap the work in clarity . I never gave the business context. I didn’t spell out why this mattered, how it connected to strategy, or what trade-offs might shape the outcome.	2	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 3)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.024937	2025-09-12 05:08:50.024937
57	429	ell out why this mattered, how it connected to strategy, or what trade-offs might shape the outcome. Without that clarity, the architect did what any strong partner would: thorough exploration, solid research, and a robust vision. But the vision leaned toward expansion, not evolution, and missed critical questions about how the product might change or even deprecate. The result? The project eventually got derailed and had to be reset. The lesson was sharp and clear: it’s not enough to delegate work—you have to create clarity in your asks. Why are we doing this? How will it connect to the business? What are the boundaries? Without that framing, even great work can veer off course. Now, whenever I set direction, I make sure the why is explicit. Clear context doesn’t constrain creativity—it channels it toward impact.

58	429	novation Define what innovation means for your company, then build a culture around that definition. Innovation is one of those words that gets thrown around a lot, but rarely defined. For a long time, I thought it meant creating flashy, groundbreaking solutions. Over time, I’ve learned that innovation isn’t just about solutions—it’s about how you define the problems worth solving, and the culture you build around addressing them. Too often, when leaders ask for “innovation,” what they really want is something else: incremental improvements, a competitive edge, or even a whole new category. Without a shared definition, teams default to chasing shiny solutions instead of understanding the purpose behind the call for innovation. The most successful innovation I’ve seen has come when we start by clarifying what we mean. Is this about finding new problems? About defending our position in the market? About reshaping our category?	4	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 5)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.028962	2025-09-12 05:08:50.028962

Once that’s clear, you can create the conditions—a culture of exploration, constant scanning of trends and competitors, and space for people to push boundaries. Hire for Evolution and Purpose Teams that last are built by hiring for evolving roles, embracing culture add, and anchoring everything in mission. If you want to build a team that lasts, you can’t just hire for today’s gaps—you hire for the role as it will evolve. Strong teams aren’t built around temporary needs; they’re built around people who can grow with the work and with each other. One major factor of building the right team is seniority; it plays a huge role in how you think about focus, impact, and potential for attrition. Junior hires tend to desire to be generalists and built a breadth of skills. They grow into the work, take on optimizations, and support smaller projects.	5	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 6)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.031666	2025-09-12 05:08:50.031666

Their focus areas should be obvious, and there should be space for skill development. Senior and staff-level hires are different. You’re not hiring them primarily to grow; you’re hiring them to own . Their role is to take on a large, complex scope that the company knows will stay true over time. As Reid Hoffman described it, senior hires often operate on a “tour of duty”—they’re brought in to tackle a mission-critical challenge for a period of years, and to leave behind stronger foundations than they found. Another major factor is understanding the cultural needs of those you might hire. I don’t believe in “culture fit.” What lasts isn’t sameness—it’s evolution. When building a team, I ask internally "What about our culture do we want to preserve?" and "What do we want to embrace as people bring themselves into it?".	6	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 7)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.034514	2025-09-12 05:08:50.034514
61	429	lture do we want to preserve?" and "What do we want to embrace as people bring themselves into it?". And when building the team, I ask "How do you contribute to evolving a team's culture?" That’s culture add . A team that lasts is one where the culture adapts, grows, and evolves with the people who join it. Lastly, I try to hire for purpose. The most important ingredient for longevity is purpose. If you want longevity, people need to care deeply about the mission. Impact and culture alone won’t sustain a team — purpose will. When people believe in the mission, they push each other, they evolve the culture, and they build resilience through challenges. Transparency builds resilience In storms, people don’t need a flawless leader—they need an honest one. Leadership isn’t always smooth sailing. There are pivots, reorganizations, and the natural turbulence of building products.	7	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 8)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.036741	2025-09-12 05:08:50.036741

In those moments, I’ve learned that the job isn’t to have all the answers—it’s to create clarity where you can, and to be honest about what you don’t know. When our company went through a major reorganization, I felt as uncertain as anyone about what the future would hold. Instead of pretending otherwise, I focused on what I could provide: helping the team understand what was changing, what wasn’t, and how we’d keep our commitment to great design intact. In difficult moments, transparency is complex. It isn’t just about sharing everything you know; it’s about communicating in a way that provides clarity, maintains psychological safety, and respects the people affected. Timing matters. When people’s jobs or roles are on the line, transparency must come with care and urgency—you owe it to your team to treat them fairly and never leave them in limbo.	8	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 9)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.039273	2025-09-12 05:08:50.039273
63	429	me with care and urgency—you owe it to your team to treat them fairly and never leave them in limbo. The takeaway for me has been this: in times of uncertainty, transparency is generally your ally. That means preempting questions, listening for murmurs of concern, and directly addressing the fear that sits beneath so many of them: is my job at risk? You can’t always remove the uncertainty, but you can remove the silence. It wasn’t perfect, but by leaning on clarity, honesty, and timing, the team adapted. We came out stronger and more resilient—not because I had all the answers, but because we faced the uncertainty together. Ambition Has Seasons Your leadership journey maps to your ambition. Understanding its timing is what makes it sustainable. Leadership is often described as a journey, not a destination—and that’s true. But what I’ve learned is that the shape of that journey is defined by ambition. At different moments, ambition can expand or contract.	9	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 10)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.041516	2025-09-12 05:08:50.041516
64	429	shape of that journey is defined by ambition. At different moments, ambition can expand or contract. Sometimes you want to push hard, take risks, and grow into the next stage. Other times, life outside of work is complex, stability matters more, or you need space to sustain yourself. In those moments, chasing constant ambition can lead to burnout, distraction, or lost impact. As a leader, I’ve had to recognize this in myself—and in my team. Not every season of someone’s career has to be about acceleration. Part of building sustainable leadership is identifying ambition correctly, embracing it at the right time, and respecting when it needs to pause. Lessons Learned Across all of these experiences, a few principles stand out: Coaching scales – Coaching creates more leaders, while dictating only creates followers. Clarity drives execution – Delegation without context isn’t empowerment; it’s drift. Define innovation – Innovation isn’t novelty, it’s cultural.	10	size	Leadership Lessons from Product Design (Part 11)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-11 18:47:43.941978	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.043565	2025-09-12 05:08:50.043565

Hire for evolution and purpose – Teams last when you hire for roles that grow, value culture add, and anchor in mission. Transparency builds resilience – In uncertainty, timing and honesty matter more than polish. Ambition has seasons – Not every moment requires acceleration. Sustainable leadership respects when ambition expands and when it contracts.

66	430	When Good Work Falls Flat In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I was a Design Director overseeing teams working in new areas—freelancer tooling, admin actions—and a few of our solutions weren’t sticking. Some shipped features looked promising at first, but they didn’t make much impact. The riskiest bet was a time-tracking feature. It was polished, but it wasn’t solving anything people really cared about. My Role as Design Director This was my responsibility. Not to redesign the feature myself, but to help my team figure out why our work wasn’t landing—and to help them build the skills to avoid this trap in the future. The Real Problem When I dug in, I realized what was happening. The team was moving fast, which usually I encourage, but in this case speed had a cost. Designers were focusing on user experience details and execution, but skipping the hard part: validating value. We weren’t asking, is this the right problem? or does this solution actually matter?	0	size	Turning Flat Solutions Into Impactful Ones   (Part 1)	Blog Post	#management, #process, #leadership	0.9	post_68	2025-09-05 13:01:06.981764	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.048803	2025-09-12 05:08:50.048803
67	430	lidating value. We weren’t asking, is this the right problem? or does this solution actually matter? Effort was being measured in design hours, not in ROI. Resetting with a Framework I knew we needed a reset. I brought the designers together and shared a framework I rely on: diagnosis, principles, actions. We diagnosed the issue—too much energy on polish, not enough on value. We agreed on principles to guide us: scope to impact, show your work so feedback comes early, and break things down instead of going all in on big bets. Then we turned those into actions: identify risk up front, align on design time needed, document the process and share it with partners, and test value on medium- and large-sized projects before going too deep. How the Team Responded The team ran with it. One designer introduced lightweight “plans of action” that made our design process transparent and invited PMs in earlier.	1	size	Turning Flat Solutions Into Impactful Ones   (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management, #process, #leadership	0.9	post_68	2025-09-05 13:01:06.981764	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.051092	2025-09-12 05:08:50.051092
68	430	d lightweight “plans of action” that made our design process transparent and invited PMs in earlier. Another led concept testing sessions, bringing early user feedback into critiques before ideas hardened. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, concept tests were informing direction, and PMs were leaning in with curiosity instead of just waiting for handoffs. What Changed The shift was dramatic. Riskier projects started getting tested for value before anyone sunk months of work. Vague ideas like “time tracking” sharpened into clear problems like “help me get paid,” and then into focused solutions like “create me an invoice.” Designers weren’t just executing—they were shaping strategy. PMs began engaging more deeply in the design process, and the team itself started adding new process ideas beyond the ones I’d suggested. Our solutions got smaller, sharper, and less risky.	2	size	Turning Flat Solutions Into Impactful Ones   (Part 3)	Blog Post	#management, #process, #leadership	0.9	post_68	2025-09-05 13:01:06.981764	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.052874	2025-09-12 05:08:50.052874

71	432	The Challenge When I first joined Dropbox, I inherited a small team of three ICs working on Onboarding. They were in the middle of a transition—from acting as a service arm to PM partners toward becoming embedded in squads. The problem was that they weren’t able to get ahead of the work. Instead of shaping strategy, they were shipping small optimizations: moving a button here, tweaking a flow there, A/B testing everything. The work was revenue-generating, but the quality and impact of solutions were starting to degrade. Watching this pattern, I realized we were heading in the wrong direction. My Role As Design Director, it was my responsibility to make sure the solutions were not only good but impactful. I also needed to motivate the team by giving them meaningful problems to solve—not just incremental tasks handed down from PMs. Resetting the Strategy I started by analyzing the reality of the situation: why were we stuck in small optimizations?	0	size	Breaking Out of Incrementalism (Part 1)	Blog Post	#management, #process, #leadership, #strategy	0.9	post_73	2025-09-04 04:48:58.184977	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.061073	2025-09-12 05:08:50.061073
72	432	ategy I started by analyzing the reality of the situation: why were we stuck in small optimizations? My conclusion was that the team lacked a clear process to shape bigger opportunities. So I drafted a strategy framework: Draft → Identify opportunities and outline hypotheses. Align → Partner with PMs and stakeholders to ensure we were chasing the right goals. Iterate and Refine → Explore multiple design directions, not just one. Validate → Run concept testing with users to confirm value early. Execute → Deliver solutions with confidence that they mattered. I socialized this approach with PM partners, showing them how a more strategic design process could still serve business needs while unlocking bigger opportunities. The Results The shift was significant. By validating ideas earlier and aligning on impact, we moved away from low-leverage optimizations toward more meaningful improvements in onboarding. Designers felt more motivated because they were working on problems that mattered.	1	size	Breaking Out of Incrementalism (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management, #process, #leadership, #strategy	0.9	post_73	2025-09-04 04:48:58.184977	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.063912	2025-09-12 05:08:50.063912

Maybe / 1 Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? Yes / 2 Knowing that competition actually will drive change is by far the most important idea to validate before moving forward. Without this, we don't have a product. Assumption Example Two Let's imagine we are at a later stage with the app where people are using it, but we aren't seeing a significant reduction in energy usage. Let's look at two assumptions and score them: People don't know how to reduce their energy usage. [4] Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid?

Maybe / 1 Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? No / 0 Will solving this add immediate business value? Maybe / 1 Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? No / 0 These two score closely. The main difference is the risk we run of not solving for the first assumption. If people don't know how to reduce their energy usage, then we can never hit our goal of energy reduction and our product fails.

It is the second step to setting up an experiment, right after establishing your risky assumption. ==If you can't articulate a hypothesis, then you don't have an experiment.== ==The most straightforward and clear way to write a hypothesis is the _if_ / _then_ format.== Let's break it down. The "If" ==The if is an isolated change in the application that will lead to a desired behavior or outcome and should be coupled with your assumption.== It can be as simple as better feedback, or as complex as adding a feature. I try to write these as solutions. From there, you should be able to infer the desire or needs of the user - or better yet, a problem they are facing.

Although you _could_ measure how happy a person is, it is generally difficult to rely on. Good examples: Then we will get more _sign ups_. Then users will _share_ the app with each other. Then more users will participate in the forum. Bad examples: Then the users will have more fun. Then the users wont be so annoyed.

Mikhaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who coined the term, writes about "flow" in his book _Flow_ - first published in 1990. Csikszentmihalyi outlines the qualifications a flow state, and the conditions needed to create one. While I was reading it, it dawned on me how many conditions of flow are baked-in to good design. I am writing a more in depth post about designing for flow, but in the meantime, this post lists the qualifications and conditions of flow to consider when designing.

Once I have established a general layout, I like to use the browser for tweaking styles and component placement. I have no hard-and-fast rule about when to make the transition from a design tool to the browser, other than when I feel like I am making a lot of minor adjustments to my design file. At that point, it usually means that I am generally happy with the design and it's time to get a little more nitty gritty and try things out. This is also great when you aren't starting a design from scratch, rather iteration to optimize, or perhaps adding a new feature. The most cumbersome thing about designing in the browser is the tools that are available to work with. You either write the CSS locally and refresh the browser, or fidget with the browser tools to see what you like then copy that over to your CSS.	0	size	Styling a Rails App in the Browser (Part 1)	Blog Post	#code	0.9	post_12	2023-07-14 18:03:35.401125	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.102368	2025-09-12 05:08:50.102368

However, ==you should have confidence that there is a potential business behind the problem you are solving, and that other people want that problem solved.== If you feel that sense of confidence, you should continue to move forward and spend energy on gathering quantitative information that there are more than 5-10 potential customers. Think of this as high-level market research. ==We want to gather quantitative data to build more confidence that there is a market interested in your unique value proposition.== We want to put our idea in front of as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and learn if those people resonate with the problem we are solving and the unique value proposition.

Assuming you have already done your customer development (if not, get out of the building!), a next good step might be the Google Keywords research method. This should help you build more confidence that a larger audience is looking for a solution to the problem you want to solve.

Some of the teams I've worked with celebrate removing lines of code, but ==more often then not, people believe that what they made is too valuable to throw away== (even if it can be brought back using Github, Abstract or the myriad other forms of version control.) The feeling of sunk costs comes in many forms: you might care what others think of you or that you'll regret quitting because you might be on to something. What I encounter most often is a team that feels their work is too valuable to toss. ==This is known as the IKEA effect: labor equals valuation.== The IKEA effect was coined by Michael I.

97	441	Meeting fatigue is a common issue in this Virtual First world we work in. There are loads of reasons that video meetings feel taxing. What stood out to me is the actual effect that back-to-back video meetings has on your brain. Some recent research done by Zoom and Microsoft brought to light that back-to- back video meetings has a negative effect on the brain. After about 60 minutes of constant video chatting, the brain starts to react as if it’s under stress. Solution According to the research, taking 10 minute breaks between Zoom meetings has the very positive result of keeping your brain out of the stress zone. We’ve known breaks are good, but it’s not always easy to take them. My plan is simple — create a meeting culture that prioritizes breaks. Principles Start meetings late. When we end meetings early it’s easy to run over time. However people rarely show up early if you start them late. Meetings should be short.

102	443	When interviewing or reviewing your own performance, it's good to have a framework that will pull the important parts of your experience to the surface. You want to show how you behave in certain circumstances, and what the results of those behaviors are. STAR turns experiences into clear, memorable stories of impact. The STAR method is one way to turn an experience into a story that will give the details your interviewer or manager needs. S — Situation Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example. T — Task Describe your scope and responsibility in that situation. A — Action Explain in detail what steps you took to address the situation. R — Result Share what outcomes your actions achieved. Why use STAR? The STAR method works because it keeps your story focused.

In short: STAR keeps your stories concrete, memorable, and easy for others to follow. Example: Leading a Design Sprint Situation: Our team at Dropbox was facing declining activation metrics, and leadership asked us to generate bold new ideas. Task: As design lead, I needed to guide the team toward a high-impact concept within two weeks. Action: I set up a modified Google Ventures Design Sprint, aligned PM and engineering partners, and facilitated sessions to define problems, sketch solutions, and test prototypes with real users.

104	444	The Challenge In Q3 of 2022, my team at Dropbox faced a daunting project: a new license type called “Flexible Licensing.” The initial estimate was that it would take 12–18 months to complete. Leadership wanted proof it was worth investing that kind of time and energy, but the team saw massive technical risk and leaned toward saying “no.” My job as Design Director was to break that deadlock and find a way to move forward without overcommitting. Resetting Expectations The turning point came in a meeting with area and group leads where an Engineering Manager and a Product Design Manager argued that the scope was simply too large. I immediately challenged the “no” response. With support from partners, I reframed the problem: don’t block it—scope the risk instead. That shift forced the team to articulate the specific risks and explore possible solutions rather than shutting the project down.	0	size	Turning Constraints Into Better Outcomes (Part 1)	Blog Post	#quality, #validation, #leadership, #frameworks	0.9	post_30	2025-09-04 04:35:04.482743	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.14296	2025-09-12 05:08:50.14296

Speed as a Strategic Constraint Instead of aiming for perfection, I challenged the team to show what they could validate in just six weeks. Speed became a constraint, not a liability. With that framing, the team identified ways to mitigate risk: launching with a small beta group rather than every platform, using design and communication to set expectations clearly, and focusing only on the most critical functionality. An Engineering Manager stepped up with a scrappy but well-thought-out plan, proving that the concept could move forward with limited investment. What We Delivered The team shipped an alpha version of Flexible Licensing to a small set of willing adopters. Designers broke the problem into manageable parts, engineers mapped out dependencies we could avoid, and together we delivered something valuable without waiting years.	1	size	Turning Constraints Into Better Outcomes (Part 2)	Blog Post	#quality, #validation, #leadership, #frameworks	0.9	post_30	2025-09-04 04:35:04.482743	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.145214	2025-09-12 05:08:50.145214

Some platform-specific benefits had to wait, but by narrowing scope, the timeline shrank dramatically. The alpha not only validated the concept but also gave us room to focus on quality where it mattered most. The result was a smaller, sharper, more useful solution that scaled because customers immediately found value in it. &gt; “Constraints don’t just speed you up—they can actually make the work better.” Key Lessons Challenge assumptions instead of accepting “no.” Use constraints strategically—speed can sharpen focus. Break complex problems into parts that can be validated. Validate value before investing heavily. Leverage beta groups to learn fast. Quality often emerges from working within limits.	2	size	Turning Constraints Into Better Outcomes (Part 3)	Blog Post	#quality, #validation, #leadership, #frameworks	0.9	post_30	2025-09-04 04:35:04.482743	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.147432	2025-09-12 05:08:50.147432
107	445	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, a couple of our solutions in emerging spaces had fallen flat. One of the riskiest bets, a time-tracking feature, absorbed design energy but failed to resonate. As a manager, my responsibility wasn’t just to help ship better solutions—it was also to help my designers grow. That meant taking a closer look at why our work was missing the mark, and how we could adjust. Diagnosing What Went Wrong What I found was simple, but telling. Designers were moving fast, but at the expense of value validation. They focused on polishing user experience while skipping over the deeper question: was this even worth building? The investment was measured only in design time, not in business or customer impact. A Framework for Change To course-correct, I leaned on a familiar framework: diagnosis, principles, actions. The diagnosis was clear—we were skipping the hard work of testing for value.	0	size	Improving Solution Value (Part 1)	Blog Post	#problemsolving, #performance, #roi, #process	0.9	post_31	2025-09-12 04:49:53.692632	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.150057	2025-09-12 05:08:50.150057
108	445	s, principles, actions. The diagnosis was clear—we were skipping the hard work of testing for value. The principles I introduced were designed to shift our mindset: scope to impact, show your work so others can give feedback early, and break things down before running too far ahead. The actions followed naturally: assess the risk level of each project, align on the design time required, document and share the design process, and validate value for medium-to-large efforts before committing. Putting It Into Practice One designer translated these principles into “plans of action,” lightweight but transparent documents that showed how design work would unfold. This transparency invited PMs and stakeholders in earlier and built accountability across the team. Another designer led “concept testing,” structured sessions to validate value before investing in execution. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, feedback came in earlier, and concept testing became a staple in critiques.	1	size	Improving Solution Value (Part 2)	Blog Post	#problemsolving, #performance, #roi, #process	0.9	post_31	2025-09-12 04:49:53.692632	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.152199	2025-09-12 05:08:50.152199
109	445	ere being shared openly, feedback came in earlier, and concept testing became a staple in critiques. The Shift We Saw The results were immediate. Riskier projects were tested for value upfront, leading to early pivots instead of late scrambles. Loosely defined problems sharpened into specific needs—“time tracking” reframed as “help me get paid,” which ultimately became “create me an invoice.” PMs started engaging more deeply in the design process, and designers themselves began sharing new methods, turning these initial fixes into cultural habits. Our solutions became smaller, more validated, and far less risky. &gt; “By slowing down just enough to validate value, we actually sped up the path to solutions that mattered.” What I Took Away Looking back, I realized that frameworks give teams clarity, transparency builds accountability, and testing for value must come before polishing design. Most importantly, leadership wasn’t about having all the answers.	2	size	Improving Solution Value (Part 3)	Blog Post	#problemsolving, #performance, #roi, #process	0.9	post_31	2025-09-12 04:49:53.692632	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.15439	2025-09-12 05:08:50.15439

111	446	The Challenge At Grow Therapy, we identified intersession engagement as a critical strategic priority. The therapy experience couldn't just happen once a week in a one-hour session. To deliver better care, support providers, and demonstrate outcomes strong enough to maintain insurance contracts, we had to improve the quality of care that happened between sessions. The Solution Session Topics Feature We designed a system that prompted clients to reflect on their therapy experience before sessions. Key features included: Guided Reflection: Help clients who struggle with reflection AI Summarization: Convert open reflections into actionable topics Dynamic Prompting: Contextual timing based on client journey Provider Preparation: Clear, concise summaries for therapists Design Philosophy The solution focused on helping people who don't know how to reflect, rather than just serving those who already had the habit.	0	size	Intersession Engagement Strategy (Part 1)	Blog Post	#ux, #engagement, #behavioralpsychology, #impact	0.9	post_32	2025-09-02 04:01:15.231816	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.159071	2025-09-12 05:08:50.159071

113	447	Design principles are everywhere. Most design orgs have them, but too often they sit in a Notion doc or slide deck, rarely shaping real decisions. The challenge isn’t just writing principles—it’s creating ones that teams believe in, use, and hold each other accountable to. Why Have Design Principles? Create alignment → Give teams a shared lens for making decisions, reducing subjective debates. Connect design to company ethos → Anchor design choices in the broader mission, not just aesthetics. Raise quality consistently → Define what “good” looks like so the bar isn’t left to interpretation. Accelerate decision-making → Provide a shortcut when trade-offs or conflicts arise. Scale design thinking cross-functionally → Make design values accessible to PMs, engineers, and others, not just designers. Start with Listening, Not Writing The first step isn’t drafting. It’s listening.	0	size	Creating Design Principles That Get Used (Part 1)	Blog Post	#productdesign, #principles, #process, #leadership, #ux	0.9	post_34	2025-09-04 04:34:13.656504	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.164904	2025-09-12 05:08:50.164904

Before any words go on the page, I’ve found it essential to run a listening tour—surveying designers, PMs, engineers, and researchers about what feels inconsistent in the work. Ask questions like: Do we feel aligned in how we make design decisions? Do our design choices reflect the company’s values and ethos? Do we have a shared understanding of what “quality” means in our work? Do disagreements in critique or product reviews often feel subjective? Do cross-functional partners understand how design makes decisions? Patterns emerge quickly, and they highlight the gaps principles can fill. Involve the Right Stakeholders Early Design principles aren’t just for designers. If they only live in critique sessions or design documentation, they won’t influence the broader product.	1	size	Creating Design Principles That Get Used (Part 2)	Blog Post	#productdesign, #principles, #process, #leadership, #ux	0.9	post_34	2025-09-04 04:34:13.656504	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.167236	2025-09-12 05:08:50.167236
115	447	ey only live in critique sessions or design documentation, they won’t influence the broader product. That’s why it’s critical to involve cross-functional partners early—PMs, engineering leads, brand design, even executives. Without their buy-in, principles risk becoming “design wallpaper.” At Grow Therapy, we drafted a thoughtful set of principles: Prioritize the therapeutic relationship Support, don’t overshadow Celebrate growth, big and small Be inclusive and compassionate by design Each principle came with clear “when done right” and “when done wrong” examples, plus product tie-ins from rescheduling, reviews, and treatment plans. They were grounded in the actual problems we were solving. But here’s the hard truth: they were never adopted. Why? Because I didn’t bring the right stakeholders in early enough. Brand Design wanted to lead, but they were waiting on company-wide principles. Our VP of Product wasn’t engaged early, so alignment never solidified.	2	size	Creating Design Principles That Get Used (Part 3)	Blog Post	#productdesign, #principles, #process, #leadership, #ux	0.9	post_34	2025-09-04 04:34:13.656504	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.169196	2025-09-12 05:08:50.169196

We ended up in a waiting game, and the staff designer I asked to drive the effort didn’t have clear channels to get feedback and input from those who mattered most. The principles were strong. The process was weak. Choose the Right Owner Every principle needs a champion, but not a dictator. The right owner is someone who can communicate clearly, bring people along in the process, and keep the focus on collaboration over ego. Low ego, high drive, and strong facilitation skills are the traits to look for. Ownership here is about stewardship—ensuring principles evolve with the team and get used in the day-to-day. If I could go back, I’d have paired the staff designer with a more senior sponsor—someone who had visibility and credibility across leadership—to make sure the right doors got opened.	3	size	Creating Design Principles That Get Used (Part 4)	Blog Post	#productdesign, #principles, #process, #leadership, #ux	0.9	post_34	2025-09-04 04:34:13.656504	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.171184	2025-09-12 05:08:50.171184

118	448	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I found myself in the middle of a tension that’s common in large organizations: conflicting directives from leadership. My group was focused on collaboration within teams, spanning across the Pro SKU, Business Standard, and Enterprise. At the start of the quarter, my PM partner was advised to divest from Enterprise clients and lean toward short-term revenue. Meanwhile, my boss instructed me to go deeper into Enterprise and invest in a new admin experience. Both perspectives had merit, but they pointed us in opposite directions. Diagnosing the Conflict The misalignment surfaced in a team leads meeting. My PM partner and I compared notes and realized that what our respective leaders were asking us to prioritize didn’t line up. When we raised this misalignment, stakeholders asked us to demonstrate a feasible path forward rather than just flag the problem. Digging deeper, we uncovered a few important dynamics.	0	size	Navigating Conflicting Directives\n (Part 1)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #coaching	0.9	post_70	2025-09-04 04:48:34.980618	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.175814	2025-09-12 05:08:50.175814
119	448	th forward rather than just flag the problem. Digging deeper, we uncovered a few important dynamics. A senior architect was advocating for the admin opportunity and had the ear of my boss, partly through past backchannel conversations. At the same time, company goals were clearly oriented toward short-term revenue. The disconnect wasn’t just about strategy—it was also about communication breakdowns and a lack of clear roles. Actions to Move Forward The first step was to repair communication. I sat down with the senior architect and clarified roles and responsibilities: I would remain accountable for strategy, and he would be responsible for execution. That created much-needed clarity. Next, I worked with my PM partner to reestablish priority. We were able to align stakeholders on the importance of short-term revenue, but there was no agreement on the right approach.	1	size	Navigating Conflicting Directives\n (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #coaching	0.9	post_70	2025-09-04 04:48:34.980618	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.177939	2025-09-12 05:08:50.177939
120	448	keholders on the importance of short-term revenue, but there was no agreement on the right approach. To break the deadlock, I proposed a compromise: give the architect a three-week runway to see if the admin initiative could be broken into smaller pieces that might generate faster revenue. We allocated DS and PMM support for exploration, while also pushing forward with PMs and design leads on expanding paid security features, which had clearer near-term upside. Results and Lessons The architect ran lightweight concept testing with smaller enterprise clients, partnered with PMM for customer conversations, and collaborated with DS on data exploration. Despite the effort, we didn’t find a credible short-term revenue path. With evidence in hand, we communicated our recommendation to divest from Enterprise and refocus on nearer-term opportunities.	2	size	Navigating Conflicting Directives\n (Part 3)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #coaching	0.9	post_70	2025-09-04 04:48:34.980618	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.180297	2025-09-12 05:08:50.180297

First, misalignment often stems from communication gaps as much as from strategy itself. Second, defining clear roles and responsibilities helps build trust and avoids power struggles. And finally, when faced with conflicting directives, creating a structured way to test assumptions not only brings clarity, it helps stakeholders feel heard—even if their preferred path isn’t the one pursued.	3	size	Navigating Conflicting Directives\n (Part 4)	Blog Post	#management, #leadership, #coaching	0.9	post_70	2025-09-04 04:48:34.980618	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.182501	2025-09-12 05:08:50.182501
122	449	The Challenge In Q1 of 2021, activation work at Dropbox was inconsistent. My team had developed an effective strategy for helping new users get to value, but outside of our group, the approach wasn’t being used. Other teams were working on their own versions of “new user experience,” but the results weren’t impactful or aligned with the strategy we knew worked. Without adoption beyond our group, our impact was limited. My Role As a Design Director, my responsibility was to improve the outcomes of design work—not just in my team, but across the company. That meant scaling our activation thinking beyond our walls and creating a foundation others could adopt. Building the Framework The first step was to codify what worked. I drafted an activation framework that captured the principles behind our success and began socializing it with designers outside my group.	0	size	Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact (Part 1)	Blog Post	#leadership, #strategy, #frameworks	0.9	post_71	2025-09-04 04:04:48.435616	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.185034	2025-09-12 05:08:50.185034
123	449	captured the principles behind our success and began socializing it with designers outside my group. To build momentum, I also started an “Onboarding Guild,” a forum where designers could seek advice on building activation solutions. Adoption was slow. Even though the framework was clear and rooted in the CCC model, most teams continued to do their own thing. I realized we needed more than documentation—we needed proof. Changing the Evangelization Strategy I asked two teams to apply the framework and capture their results. These case studies became the evidence we needed. With that in hand, I shifted my strategy: instead of sending the framework to individual designers, I started sharing it directly with cross-functional leads. I showcased team wins in relevant forums and in all-function Slack channels, making the framework’s value visible to PMs, engineers, and other stakeholders.	1	size	Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact (Part 2)	Blog Post	#leadership, #strategy, #frameworks	0.9	post_71	2025-09-04 04:04:48.435616	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.188002	2025-09-12 05:08:50.188002

Teams that used the framework improved their activation experiences, and over time it became a standard approach across the company. The Onboarding Guild continued under new leadership, carrying the culture forward. The framework didn’t just improve design outcomes—it shaped how Dropbox thought about activation as a whole and even justified investment into a platform for pre-in-product data collection.	2	size	Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact (Part 3)	Blog Post	#leadership, #strategy, #frameworks	0.9	post_71	2025-09-04 04:04:48.435616	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.190578	2025-09-12 05:08:50.190578
125	450	In Q1 of 2020, while leading design at Dropbox, I faced one of the more difficult parts of people management: helping a talented designer who was underperforming. Over several months, I had noticed that one of my designers’ work was slipping. Their solutions were consistently overcomplicated, they were slow to deliver, and the final outputs often missed the core value we needed to ship. Confidence was waning, and feedback from peers reflected the same struggles. Previous attempts to coach them back on track hadn’t stuck, and eventually they received a low review score and landed on a formal performance plan. As their manager, it was my responsibility to ensure Dropbox maintained a high-quality design bar. But equally, I felt responsible for their growth, morale, and clarity. The challenge was clear: I had to balance empathy for the individual with accountability to the team and company.	0	size	Turning Struggle Into Growth (Part 1)	Blog Post	#management, #coaching	0.9	post_74	2025-09-04 05:39:33.384697	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.193279	2025-09-12 05:08:50.193279
126	450	was clear: I had to balance empathy for the individual with accountability to the team and company. Getting to the Root Cause I began with a direct conversation, not just to deliver feedback but to invite their own perspective. My goal was to align our perceptions of what wasn’t working. When we sat down, they shared that motivation was the deeper issue. They didn’t feel energized by their current projects — smaller, incremental improvements — and longed instead for big, sweeping feature launches. In their mind, impact meant scale. This insight reframed the problem. The gap wasn’t only skill or output; it was motivation. Reframing the Work We talked openly about how to approach the situation differently. Instead of focusing on one large project, I encouraged them to view smaller projects as opportunities to ship quickly, build momentum, and practice restraint. Constraints, in this case, could be empowering.	1	size	Turning Struggle Into Growth (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management, #coaching	0.9	post_74	2025-09-04 05:39:33.384697	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.195529	2025-09-12 05:08:50.195529
127	450	hip quickly, build momentum, and practice restraint. Constraints, in this case, could be empowering. I asked them to design their own improvement plan: specific skills to work on, clear milestones, and goals tied to the team’s roadmap. Together, we agreed on shorter timelines and limited exploration for each project, ensuring they stayed focused. I committed to weekly check-ins and made sure to gather peer feedback so they could see where they were improving. The Turnaround Over the next three months, their approach shifted. With tighter timelines and smaller scopes, they moved faster, delivered simpler solutions, and regained confidence. Their performance improved enough to come off the performance plan. The team benefitted as well: solution quality rose, and we shipped more consistently. But while performance improved, their motivations didn’t change. They still felt underutilized focusing on smaller projects.	2	size	Turning Struggle Into Growth (Part 3)	Blog Post	#management, #coaching	0.9	post_74	2025-09-04 05:39:33.384697	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.198083	2025-09-12 05:08:50.198083
128	450	proved, their motivations didn’t change. They still felt underutilized focusing on smaller projects. After six months, they decided to leave Dropbox for a role better aligned with their passions. What I Learned This experience taught me that performance management is as much about understanding motivation as it is about addressing skill gaps. By reframing the work and creating constraints, I was able to help this designer improve in the short term and leave on better terms in the long run. For the business, it was a win: we shipped stronger work and maintained momentum during a critical period. For the designer, it was also a win: they left with clarity about what truly motivated them, and a chance to pursue work that better fit their strengths. Not every performance story ends in long-term retention. Sometimes success looks like coaching someone through a rough patch, holding them accountable, and ultimately helping them find the right environment where they can thrive.	3	size	Turning Struggle Into Growth (Part 4)	Blog Post	#management, #coaching	0.9	post_74	2025-09-04 05:39:33.384697	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.20007	2025-09-12 05:08:50.20007

130	451	The Challenge In early 2020, I noticed one of my designers struggling. Their solutions were overly complex and often missed the core value of the problem. Feedback from peers confirmed what I was seeing: they tended to overthink, move slowly, and deliver work that didn’t land. The decline in confidence showed up in reviews as well, leading to a low performance score and eventually a performance plan. As their manager, it was my responsibility not just to hold the bar on quality, but to support this person as a designer and as a teammate. Getting to the Root We sat down to talk openly about their performance. I presented the feedback I’d gathered, but more importantly, I asked them to share their perspective. I wanted us to align on expectations and uncover what was really going on. What emerged was motivation. They weren’t excited by small, incremental improvements. What they wanted was to build big, impactful features in nascent areas—fast.	0	size	Managing Performance With Empathy (Part 1)	Blog Post	#management, #sustainability, #coaching	0.9	post_75	2025-09-05 12:35:59.190215	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.204751	2025-09-12 05:08:50.204751

But when the reality of their work didn’t match that vision, they lost energy and fell into overcomplication. Reframing the Work Together, we reframed the challenge. Instead of waiting for one big, perfect project, we set up a structure around smaller ones. I asked them to create a plan that addressed their challenges directly, with goals, milestones, and specific skills to improve. The biggest change was introducing tighter timelines and limiting exploration for smaller projects. This gave them constraints to work within and a chance to build momentum. I ensured their milestones aligned with the team’s roadmap and held weekly check-ins to track progress. We also built in feedback loops so they could hear directly how their work was landing. The Outcome The change was noticeable. Within three months, their speed and quality improved.	1	size	Managing Performance With Empathy (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management, #sustainability, #coaching	0.9	post_75	2025-09-05 12:35:59.190215	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.207126	2025-09-12 05:08:50.207126

They used the tighter timelines as a motivator and successfully got out of their performance plan. The team benefited as well—solution quality went up, and we shipped more. But while performance improved, motivation didn’t. They still felt underutilized by focusing on smaller projects. We tried to create opportunities for them to work on larger initiatives, but we couldn’t find the right fit inside Dropbox. Six months later, they left for a role that better matched their aspirations. What I Learned This experience reinforced two truths of management. First, that structure, constraints, and direct feedback can help someone turn performance around. And second, that motivation matters as much as skill. Sometimes, even if you can fix performance, you can’t fix fit. &gt; “You can help someone meet expectations, but if their motivations don’t align, the success may only be temporary.”	2	size	Managing Performance With Empathy (Part 3)	Blog Post	#management, #sustainability, #coaching	0.9	post_75	2025-09-05 12:35:59.190215	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.209091	2025-09-12 05:08:50.209091
133	452	The Challenge In Q2 of 2021, I was managing a high-performing Design Manager at Dropbox—let’s call her Maya. She excelled across the board—design process, strategy, craft, and communication. She led a team of four ICs and was respected by her peers. During a career conversation, Maya shared her desire for a promotion. Promotions can be motivating, but they’re not always in a manager’s control. My job was to ensure she felt supported, that her strengths were maximized, and that we aligned her day-to-day work with what truly motivated her. My Coaching Approach When coaching high performers, I focus on three things: Understand their core motivation Give them choices that align with that motivation Connect their work to visible progress toward it With Maya, it quickly became clear that her motivation was about scope. She wanted to scale her impact in strategy and process—those were the areas that energized her.	0	size	DraftMotivating High Performers Through Scope and Strategy   (Part 1)	Blog Post	#management, #coaching, #performance	0.9	post_76	2025-09-05 12:45:52.736242	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.211606	2025-09-12 05:08:50.211606
134	452	ope. She wanted to scale her impact in strategy and process—those were the areas that energized her. We agreed that demonstrating those skills at scale would also improve her chances of promotion, even if the timing of that outcome wasn’t fully in our control. Finding the Right Opportunities Maya and I set aside time for a working session to brainstorm ways she could stretch her scope. We both brought ideas, and ultimately we chose two: She would own a cross-group process project focused on feature validation and experimentation. She would delegate craft quality responsibilities to a senior IC, which gave that person greater influence while freeing Maya to focus on strategy. We checked with cross-functional partners to ensure alignment and adjusted Maya’s goals to reflect these new responsibilities. From there, we set up monthly check-ins to track her progress. What Happened Next Maya ran with the opportunity.	1	size	DraftMotivating High Performers Through Scope and Strategy   (Part 2)	Blog Post	#management, #coaching, #performance	0.9	post_76	2025-09-05 12:45:52.736242	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.214672	2025-09-12 05:08:50.214672
135	452	we set up monthly check-ins to track her progress. What Happened Next Maya ran with the opportunity. She took ownership of the experimentation process, brought in two other leads, and rolled it out thoughtfully. It quickly sped up decision-making, killed projects that weren’t worth pursuing, and saved us from over-investment. Within months, the process scaled to the entire Group and was being considered for adoption across the org. At the same time, she deepened her strategic impact. She defined the solution space for users on multiple teams, and she led the strategy for bringing Dropbox into business chat apps. Delegating craft quality gave her the headroom to operate at this higher level. The Outcome Maya was motivated, happy, and visibly increasing her impact. She was leading process improvements that changed how the organization worked, while contributing strategy on high-priority projects. And as a cherry on top, she was promoted to Senior Design Manager.	2	size	DraftMotivating High Performers Through Scope and Strategy   (Part 3)	Blog Post	#management, #coaching, #performance	0.9	post_76	2025-09-05 12:45:52.736242	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.216902	2025-09-12 05:08:50.216902
136	453	Getting Design Involved in Strategy How We Shifted Growth Work From Optimizations to Impactful Projects at Dropbox The Challenge In Q2 of 2019, I was leading a Growth team at Dropbox focused on onboarding and marketing. We had three designers serving Growth Managers, and while the work was shipping, it wasn’t hitting the mark. ROI was low, and the designers were becoming demotivated. The data told the same story: we had hit a ceiling with our optimizations. Moving buttons and running endless A/B tests could only get us so far. Meanwhile, lead meetings and 1:1s made it clear—design wasn’t contributing strategically, and the team’s energy was draining. My Role As Design Manager, I needed to ensure that the solutions we shipped were impactful, that the designers on my team were growing, and that we were moving from a service model to embedded, strategic partners.	0	size	Getting Design Involved in Strategy   (Part 1)	Blog Post	#design, #productdesign, #uxr, #impact	0.9	post_77	2025-09-05 13:02:50.893903	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.219543	2025-09-12 05:08:50.219543
137	453	my team were growing, and that we were moving from a service model to embedded, strategic partners. Resetting the Approach I started by diagnosing the issues: optimizations weren’t addressing real customer problems, designers were overloaded, and research was limited to evaluation rather than discovery. From there, I set two principles: Reserve time for bigger thinking Define problems collaboratively I aligned with my PM and Engineering partners and shifted our researcher to focus on foundational work. We sponsored a new study to uncover the unmet needs of people who abandoned onboarding. We knew when and where they dropped off—but not why. In parallel, I invested in usability tooling and process upgrades, and I carved out time for designers to think beyond incremental changes: one designer dedicated 20% of their time to future-focused work, while the other two committed 10% for two quarters. What We Found The research came back with striking insights.	1	size	Getting Design Involved in Strategy   (Part 2)	Blog Post	#design, #productdesign, #uxr, #impact	0.9	post_77	2025-09-05 13:02:50.893903	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.221986	2025-09-12 05:08:50.221986
138	453	her two committed 10% for two quarters. What We Found The research came back with striking insights. Half of the people who quit couldn’t identify which product they had tried. Many had landed in the Business SKU when they wanted something simpler—an expensive mismatch that didn’t meet their needs. Armed with this insight, the designer who had future-focused time proposed a “right-sizing” solution: guiding users to the product that actually fit their needs. That project ran for about a year, reshaping how we matched customers to SKUs. It also spawned related initiatives—upgrade and downgrade flows, and even how we approached subscription cancellation. The partnership between design and product on that work became a model for collaboration across the org. The Outcome By listening to designer sentiment, digging into the data, and sponsoring the right research, we were able to get design involved in strategy in a meaningful way.	2	size	Getting Design Involved in Strategy   (Part 3)	Blog Post	#design, #productdesign, #uxr, #impact	0.9	post_77	2025-09-05 13:02:50.893903	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.224164	2025-09-12 05:08:50.224164
139	453	sponsoring the right research, we were able to get design involved in strategy in a meaningful way. The designers were more engaged, their contributions grew in impact, and the company benefited from more thoughtful activation and acquisition solutions. &gt; “We knew when and where they quit—but not why.”	3	size	Getting Design Involved in Strategy   (Part 4)	Blog Post	#design, #productdesign, #uxr, #impact	0.9	post_77	2025-09-05 13:02:50.893903	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.225944	2025-09-12 05:08:50.225944
140	454	The Challenge In Q1 of 2021, I returned from paternity leave to a newly formed group of about 70 people. Our focus was onboarding, activation, and the Teams SKU. A few months in, more strategic operational reviews made something clear: we were running out of valuable problems to solve. In about six months, the roadmap would hit a cliff. That gap threatened morale for roughly 25 people—including three designers—and risked stalling our momentum. Without intervention, we’d be shipping solutions that technically met goals but lacked real impact. My Role I wasn’t directly responsible for the roadmap, but I was accountable for my team’s performance, morale, and attrition. If we didn’t find meaningful work, it would hurt both our solutions and our people. Creating Vision Sprints To tackle the problem, I proposed leading a structured effort to generate new opportunities.	0	size	From Ineffective to Inspired (Part 1)	Blog Post	#process, #speed, #strategy, #frameworks	0.9	post_78	2025-09-05 13:04:59.267233	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.228465	2025-09-12 05:08:50.228465
141	454	Sprints To tackle the problem, I proposed leading a structured effort to generate new opportunities. I organized working sessions with Product Design Manager colleagues, brought in PM partners, researchers, and IC designers, and set the goal of surfacing big ideas quickly. After a few days of collaboration and interviews, I formalized a new ritual: vision sprints. These week-long sprints reserved time for discovery methods, identifying unanswered questions, and exploring big-picture opportunities. I operationalized the ritual by setting expectations with design leads and their partners, then delegated ownership of the sprints to them. Together, we created a detailed day-by-day process. The design leads went on to run three separate vision sprints, each generating a pipeline of ideas. &gt; “After a few days of interviews and collaboration, I created a ‘vision sprints’ ritual.” The Outcome The sprints delivered a list of opportunities, each with different levels of validation.	1	size	From Ineffective to Inspired (Part 2)	Blog Post	#process, #speed, #strategy, #frameworks	0.9	post_78	2025-09-05 13:04:59.267233	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.230953	2025-09-12 05:08:50.230953
142	454	The Outcome The sprints delivered a list of opportunities, each with different levels of validation. Data science, research, and PMM partners helped apply high-level sizing, which guided us in deciding which ideas to experiment with, research further, or cut. The result was a refreshed, longer-term roadmap that restored momentum and focus. Even more, the vision sprint ritual proved valuable enough that it became part of our process—we repeated it twice yearly to keep the pipeline of opportunities alive. Key Lessons Even high-performing teams can stall if the opportunity pipeline runs dry. Structured rituals like vision sprints create space for strategic thinking. Delegating ownership to design leads builds both alignment and momentum. --- TL;DR (Audio-Ready Script) &gt; Navigate-To Button TL;DR How I introduced vision sprints at Dropbox to keep teams inspired and strategic when the roadmap ran dry.	2	size	From Ineffective to Inspired (Part 3)	Blog Post	#process, #speed, #strategy, #frameworks	0.9	post_78	2025-09-05 13:04:59.267233	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.23309	2025-09-12 05:08:50.23309
143	455	Strong relationships between design, engineering, and product leadership don’t happen by accident. They’re built with intention. Over time, I’ve found that the most impactful partnerships I’ve had—whether with PMs, engineers, or other leaders—follow a simple three-step framework: Set expectations Understand motivators Achieve together Step 1: Set Expectations Clarity comes first. The best relationships begin with a clear understanding of how you’ll work together. What’s expected of each role? Where are decisions made? What’s the shared rhythm? By setting expectations early, you reduce ambiguity and make sure nobody is guessing at their responsibilities. Step 2: Understand Motivators Every leader brings different motivations to the table. Some thrive on efficiency. Others care most about scale, innovation, or customer experience. Taking the time to learn what excites your partner—and what drains them—creates a foundation of trust.	0	size	A Simple Framework for Building Impactful Relationships  (Part 1)	Blog Post	#teambuilding, #frameworks	0.9	post_80	2025-09-05 14:06:57.110137	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.235975	2025-09-12 05:08:50.235975
144	455	king the time to learn what excites your partner—and what drains them—creates a foundation of trust. When you know someone’s motivators, you can align opportunities that play to their strengths and keep them engaged. Step 3: Achieve Together Nothing builds a relationship faster than shared success. Once expectations are clear and motivators are understood, the next step is to deliver something meaningful together. That achievement creates momentum, trust, and a track record you can build on. Big or small, the key is that the win is shared. You both own it. Why This Works This framework has helped me again and again—whether welcoming a new engineering manager, collaborating with a product leader, or aligning with executives. It takes relationships from transactional to strategic. It’s simple, but powerful: Set expectations so you’re aligned. Understand motivators so you’re connected. Achieve together so you’re invested.	1	size	A Simple Framework for Building Impactful Relationships  (Part 2)	Blog Post	#teambuilding, #frameworks	0.9	post_80	2025-09-05 14:06:57.110137	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.239052	2025-09-12 05:08:50.239052
145	459	The Foundation In my experience, the two tactics that have worked best in forging strong engineering–design relationships are investing in shared language and practicing inclusion. Shared language means we can talk clearly about the same constraints, trade-offs, and technical challenges. Inclusion means giving engineers a voice in product and design strategy—not just inviting them to the meeting, but making real space for them to contribute. Over time, I’ve developed a simple framework for building impactful relationships: Set expectations Understand each other’s motivators Achieve together &gt; “The best engineering relationships I’ve had were never about the delegation of solutions. They were about understanding one another and sharing a worldview.” Step 1: Set Expectations When Alex (not his real name) joined my team as a new engineering manager, my PM partner Nina (also not her real name) and I already had a rhythm for bi-weekly strategy sessions.	0	size	Building Strong Relationships Between Engineering and Design   (Part 1)	Blog Post	#teambuilding, #impact	0.9	post_79	2025-09-08 13:58:04.325803	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.24581	2025-09-12 05:08:50.24581
146	459	PM partner Nina (also not her real name) and I already had a rhythm for bi-weekly strategy sessions. From the beginning, I made it clear that Alex would be included in these sessions—not just to observe, but to participate. That expectation set the tone: he wasn’t just there to execute, he was there to shape strategy with us. Step 2: Understand Motivators Rather than rushing him into process, I spent time learning what motivated Alex. What did he care about? Where did he find energy? What did he see as his responsibility? It became clear that efficiency and scale were what lit him up. As an engineering leader, he wanted to make systems run better and remove waste. That gave us an opening to align strategy with his core motivators. Step 3: Achieve Together Strategically, we identified a major opportunity: migrating from two code bases to one.	1	size	Building Strong Relationships Between Engineering and Design   (Part 2)	Blog Post	#teambuilding, #impact	0.9	post_79	2025-09-08 13:58:04.325803	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.248464	2025-09-12 05:08:50.248464
147	459	eve Together Strategically, we identified a major opportunity: migrating from two code bases to one. It was exactly the kind of efficiency play Alex cared about, but instead of treating it as an engineering clean-up task, we reframed it as a product initiative. Together, we sized the impact from the customer, product, and business perspectives. That framing energized Alex. He saw the initiative not just as engineering work, but as strategic impact. We delivered it as a team, reducing engineering time, simplifying maintenance, and freeing capacity. More importantly, we built trust. With that trust in place, I was able to ask Alex for support in other areas, and he leaned in with confidence. What began as an onboarding moment became a long-term partnership. The Outcome The technical win was consolidating code bases, but the real outcome was the relationship. Alex shifted from a new manager with little strategy experience to a true partner in shaping our roadmap.	2	size	Building Strong Relationships Between Engineering and Design   (Part 3)	Blog Post	#teambuilding, #impact	0.9	post_79	2025-09-08 13:58:04.325803	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.250391	2025-09-12 05:08:50.250391

They wanted to learn and ship quickly and solve real problems with software.

That product would be OnPar; an educational game to improve the continuing education methods for doctors, nurses and residents. This is the story of how we built the product and helped the Mayo Clinic build an innovation practice.\n\nPlanning	1	semantic	Mayo Clinic Gamifying Medical Education (Part 2)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_mayo_gamifying_medical_education.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.764243	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.283999	2025-09-12 05:08:50.283999
162	462	Planning In our discovery phase with Mayo, we uncovered a key problem: current continuing education methods for doctors, nurses and residents were not engaging, expensive to produce, and only mildly effective.\n\nWith these insights, I created a customer development interview template and interviewed about 25 healthcare professionals and related stakeholders. The continuing education space had existing competition, but qualitative research supported our assumptions about engagement, expense, and effectiveness issues.\n\nAs the project lead, I took on multiple responsibilities:\n\nLead and execute customer development and research\n    Facilitate solution exploration and testing\n    Lead interface and experience design\n    Establish experiment process, setup and analysis\n    Develop the product roadmap and manage the project\n    Communicate with, align, and present to stakeholders\n    Build, manage, and mentor the design team	2	semantic	Mayo Clinic Gamifying Medical Education (Part 3)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_mayo_gamifying_medical_education.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.764243	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.285787	2025-09-12 05:08:50.285787
188	463	Learnings The most interesting learning was finding the buyer. Free products are never free. If a product is free, then the user is the product. With that in mind we started to look into how helping a person save money was monetizable. Through some of my partner's connections, we were able to sit down with people from American Express and Citi Bank.\n\nWhat we learned was obvious in hindsight. Banks pay a great deal of money to get an individual to open a checking or savings account. If we could use this app to guide people to opening an account, it was an acquisition play for the banks. Moreover, the more money a person has in their account, the more the bank can leverage that money. It's a win-win for the user and the bank.\n\nClosing	8	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 9)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.342714	2025-09-12 05:08:50.342714

This\n    successful product launch marked the establishment of the Mayo Clinic's\n    digital innovation lab.	16	semantic	Mayo Clinic Gamifying Medical Education (Part 17)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_mayo_gamifying_medical_education.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.764243	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.315899	2025-09-12 05:08:50.315899

The\n    two things we struggle with was shipping something scrappy under the Mayo\n    brand, and keeping the board aligned with learning as progress. We focused\n    on metrics often to show progress, but struggled with expressing how\n    important the qualitative learnings were, and that a failed version of an\n    A/B test was a path forward, not a set back. This took a lot of hand\n    holding, weekly meetings, and education. I leveraged the \n    &lt;%= link_to "Stop, Pivot, or Preserve framework", post_path(14) %&gt;\n    framework to disclose learings and progress, as well as force\n    alignment and decision making as a team.\n\nLearnings	17	semantic	Mayo Clinic Gamifying Medical Education (Part 18)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_mayo_gamifying_medical_education.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.764243	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.318633	2025-09-12 05:08:50.318633

While doctors and residents found value in the product,\n    they were reluctant to pay for it. Nurses were willing to pay, but we\n    couldn't sustain their engagement beyond 60 days. Ultimately, department\n    heads emerged as the paying customer, benefiting from the product's insights\n    into residents and nurses, enabling them to address knowledge gaps and track\n    performance in their organizations.\n\nClosing	18	semantic	Mayo Clinic Gamifying Medical Education (Part 19)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_mayo_gamifying_medical_education.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.764243	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.320567	2025-09-12 05:08:50.320567

181	463	time. A friend and I got into a discussion about how difficult it is to save money. Our conversation shifted to how our culture is a spending culture - we are pushed to spend but not to save. In our personal lives, spending occurs daily while saving occurs bi-weekly or monthly. We are very good at spending because we practice it daily, but the opposite is true of saving. As a result, spending feels easy and seamless, while saving money feels like a chore and takes effort.\n\nMoreover, we both lacked confidence in our ability to save. We felt that our spending habits were bad. We recalled that when we did have extra cash, we usually ended up spending it on socializing or unnecessary things.\n\nThe Problem\n\nI want to save money, but my current saving habits and lack of extra cash make it very difficult to save money.\n\nPlanning	1	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 2)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.328377	2025-09-12 05:08:50.328377
182	463	Planning Our next step was to do customer discovery and see if others shared this pain. Before diving into solutions, we wanted to see if other people had a similar relationship with money. We created a short list of questions and started with 5 in-person interviews.\n\nKey Findings\n\nMost people desired to save more money\n    Most people spend money every day\n    Most people had spendable income\n    Half of the people said they did not have good saving habits\n    Some people said they didn't budget\n    Few people said they spend "too much"\n    Few people said they are often encouraged by others to save money\n    Few people saved directly out of their paycheck	2	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 3)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.330655	2025-09-12 05:08:50.330655

However, our assumption that lack of extra cash led to difficulty saving was invalidated. We observed that extra cash wasn't viewed as money they should save, rather there was a perception that extra cash could be spent. After the interviews, we modified our problem statement:\n\nModified Problem Statement\n\nI have extra money that I want to save, but I have bad saving habits.\n\nAt this point we felt confident that people resonated with our problem statement and decided it was time for an abbreviated design sprint.\n\nDesigning\n\nAlmost right away we had an interesting finding. While looking at our competition, we noticed that most existing tools were directed at helping people get context around their money. They "helped" people save by offering budgets or attempting to automate the saving process.	3	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 4)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.332754	2025-09-12 05:08:50.332754
184	463	process. Looking at our competition was eye-opening. It didn't seem that anyone had actively focused on developing a person's saving habit. Rather, existing tools aimed to help people save money by monitoring spending habits. We kept this top of mind as we went through the sprint.\n\nAs we diverged, we continually found ourselves digging into the belief that: People's saving habits will be improved if we engage them in saving daily.\n\nAs we continued to sketch out solutions, we refined that statement further: Providing a person with daily encouragement and reminders to save their leftover spending cash will help develop better saving habits.\n\nFrom here we developed a user journey to help guide us through building our prototype. As we refined a potential solution, we surfaced many assumptions about our users that we needed to test.\n\nKey Assumptions	4	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 5)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.334701	2025-09-12 05:08:50.334701
185	463	Assumptions People will use one account for all daily spending\n    People want to be reminded to save money daily\n    People want the option to save\n    People will save out of spending cash, separate from bills\n\nNext we set out to build a prototype to test with users. Based on the outcome from the sprint, we started to build a prototype to test that our solution was viable and addressed our riskiest assumptions.\n\nImpact\n\nWe ran 7 user tests with our target market: people who made $80K+, currently wanted to save money, and felt that they had bad saving habits. We weren't entirely confident that this was our target market, but that was the group we had gotten the most positive feedback from.	5	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 6)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.33663	2025-09-12 05:08:50.33663

Not only did we uncover some interface and experience problems, but we got a lot of positive feedback and validation that being prompted to save money felt empowering and different from other tools. About half of the users asked to be notified when the application was to be released without being prompted.\n\nChallenges\n\nBefore we started to develop the MVP Piggy application, we spiked on the engineering side. We quickly ran into difficult technical hurdles. The immediate problem we faced was facilitating the transfer of funds from a checking account to a savings account. We were able to find a means to do so, but at a high cost. The best solution we found would cost each user $10 per month.\n\nWith a cost that high, we didn't believe that our complete solution would be viable. Five options we were considering:	6	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 7)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.338716	2025-09-12 05:08:50.338716

We felt that although you couldn't save money using the application, the daily reminders and encouragement would still be useful. Our end goal is to provide the means to directly save money without any charge to the customer, so option 5 is out of the picture for now. But before we could take this path we went in search of a buyer.\n\nLearnings	7	semantic	We Ate The Web Saving Money (Part 8)	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.340846	2025-09-12 05:08:50.340846
190	464	So you’ve got a Creative Leadership interview coming up? Congrats—you’re about to be grilled (nicely) on how you think, not just what you ship. A Creative Leadership interview usually focuses on two big things: How you set direction and strategy. How you manage quality and execution. Here are a few common questions you’ll probably face—plus how I’d tackle them using the STAR method: How have you set, communicated, and evangelized strategy? (Tip: Tell a story about a moment when you had to zoom way out, bring people along, and keep everyone aligned when things got messy.) How do you ensure quality of execution on your design team? (Hint: They’re not asking if you like pretty pixels—they want to hear how you empower others, set standards, and keep velocity high.) How have you identified opportunities, operationalized initiatives, and driven your team toward impact? (Yes, it’s a mouthful. Think: spotting a gap, rallying your crew, and shipping something that moved the needle.) Closing Thought When you’re in the hot seat, keep it simple: Be concise. Use real stories. Show how you got to the outcome, not just the outcome itself. Most of all—practice out loud. It feels silly, but when you can tell your stories smoothly, you’ll come across as thoughtful and confident. Good luck out there ✨✌️	0	semantic	Preparing for a Creative Leadership Interview (Part 1)	Blog Post	#leadership, #interviewing	0.9	post_28	2025-09-12 04:59:55.086886	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.348486	2025-09-12 05:08:50.348486
191	465	Working as a consultant, I’m always pushing for an MVP. Why? Because they’re cheaper to build, and more importantly, most people don’t actually know what to build—and they shouldn’t. Not until real users are using it, and you can clearly see and hear the value your product delivers. So, let’s chat about an MVP—a minimum viable product. An MVP should be three things: The least amount of features needed to get the job done. A journey that people can complete without so much frustration they give up. Something that adds real value. The IKEA Bed Analogy Let’s say you need a bed. If I ship you an IKEA MALM bed frame with no instructions, could you build it and have a comfy place to sleep? Sure—but with a lot of anguish. That version checks boxes one and three: it’s minimal, and it provides value in the end. But it fails box two. If people give up because the journey is too hard, it’s not an MVP—it’s just an MP. Now, add some instructions. Suddenly, the same bed is achievable.	0	size	What Makes a Real MVP?

192	465	, it’s not an MVP—it’s just an MP. Now, add some instructions. Suddenly, the same bed is achievable. The journey isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough. And that’s what makes it viable. How to Test if It’s an MVP One simple way: run a usability test. Give a user a goal and watch what happens. If they get stuck saying, “I don’t know what to do now” —and they can’t figure it out within a reasonable effort—you’ve got a problem. MVPs don’t need to be perfect, but they need to be good enough : clear, smooth, and usable, so that people can actually achieve their immediate goals and see the value. The Real Lesson Next time you’re building an MVP, don’t focus on how awesome it is. Focus on how clear it is. Because clarity is what makes something viable.	1	size	What Makes a Real MVP?

193	466	When attrition and a mid-year reorg reshuffled responsibilities in 2019, I found myself with a new product lead, someone I’d never worked with before. Let’s call her Dana. Dana was known for her execution-focused approach, while I came in with a design background full of 0→1 experience. We were different, and that could have gone either way. Setting Expectations Together The first thing I suggested was collaborative expectation-setting. Instead of me writing a list of responsibilities and Dana doing the same, we did it together. We wrote down everything we thought we owned, then compared notes to find gaps and overlaps. That gave us not just alignment, but a shared language for how we’d work. From there, I leaned on a simple framework I use for new partnerships: understand, achieve, grow . First, get to know each other’s motivators. Next, pick a project to knock out together. Finally, support each other’s growth.	0	size	Building Product Partnerships Through Trust and Innovation (Part 1)	Blog Post		0.9	post_82	2025-09-12 04:49:07.699119	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.356808	2025-09-12 05:08:50.356808

Finding Shared Motivators In those early strategy sessions, I learned Dana had a passion for innovation. She wanted to take bigger risks. That opened the door. I shared some of my favorite design tools—Design Sprints, Forum Traversing, Ritual Dissent—and we started to imagine what “innovation practice” could look like in our area. Instead of me leading, we decided to experiment together. We piloted a variation on the GV Design Sprint with two teams. The results were both actionable and morale-boosting. Dana was energized, and so was I. From Experiments to Practice One experiment led to another. We introduced new exercises, piloted an “innovation week,” and eventually made it a quarterly ritual. Dana even codified the practice in our area, giving it permanence. Along the way, we not only shipped forward-thinking product changes—we built trust.	1	size	Building Product Partnerships Through Trust and Innovation (Part 2)	Blog Post		0.9	post_82	2025-09-12 04:49:07.699119	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.358924	2025-09-12 05:08:50.358924

196	467	At the start of 2021, it became clear that our activation strategy at Dropbox was losing steam. We’d squeezed most of the value we could from generalized onboarding—file, sync, and share alone weren’t enough to keep customers engaged. Something had to change. Spotting the Opportunity In a series of working sessions with research, data science, and product partners, we pieced together a bigger picture. The data showed that while many users were getting started, too few were unlocking the deeper value of Dropbox. Our research suggested a new direction: instead of treating all customers the same, we needed to explore targeted activation —different approaches for different types of users. Making the Case As the design lead responsible for activation within the Teams SKU, I took on the task of drafting a strategic shift.	0	size	Shaping Strategy Through Targeted Activation   (Part 1)	Blog Post		0.9	post_114	2025-09-12 04:56:44.765622	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.363592	2025-09-12 05:08:50.363592

I’d been thinking about targeted activation for some time, and with the help of a passionate PM partner, we pulled together the supporting data and past research to make the case. We kicked off strategy discussions with EPD group leads, starting from the top. I proposed a two-track approach: continue generalized activation while dedicating focus to exploring targeted activation. To make that real, I suggested reorganizing our teams around distinct missions. Not everyone agreed at first. My product partner Frances pushed back on going “all in” too quickly, and rightly so. We landed on a phased rollout: start with one dedicated team, validate the opportunity, and scale from there. Together, we prepared an executive summary of the proposal, which Frances presented to senior leadership. From Idea to Strategy The first targeted activation team was formed that quarter.	1	size	Shaping Strategy Through Targeted Activation   (Part 2)	Blog Post		0.9	post_114	2025-09-12 04:56:44.765622	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.365961	2025-09-12 05:08:50.365961

By the end of the year, four teams were working on targeted activation experiments. What started as a side bet became the foundation for how Dropbox approached activation moving forward. The lesson: strategy isn’t just about spotting what’s next—it’s about framing the opportunity, building alignment, and pacing the rollout so momentum grows. What I Took Away This experience reinforced how design leaders can shape strategy: by connecting insights across functions, making the case with evidence, and helping teams take manageable steps toward a bigger change. Strategy isn’t a one-time declaration; it’s a process of building conviction across the organization.	2	size	Shaping Strategy Through Targeted Activation   (Part 3)	Blog Post		0.9	post_114	2025-09-12 04:56:44.765622	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.368043	2025-09-12 05:08:50.368043
199	468	When designing for AI, there are three essential parts of the interaction we need to consider: the input, the output, and the reward. The input is the information a user sends to the machine. The output is the machine’s response back to the user. The reward is what the user does in response to the output—essentially, a second input that either reinforces or challenges the system. These interactions can be overt or hidden. Overt inputs and rewards are intentional: typing into a chat box, clicking “thumbs up,” or asking for a regenerated response. Hidden ones are unintentional: behavioral data like how long a user lingers, where they drop off, or what they ignore. Both feed the system and shape future outputs. Why the Use Case Matters The use case ultimately determines how we design the inputs, outputs, and rewards. For example, take ChatGPT’s chat. The real purpose of the product isn’t just to answer questions—it’s to learn how people interact with conversational AI and train the model.	0	size	Designing for AI Interactions: Input, Output, and Reward (Part 1)	Blog Post		0.9	post_24	2025-09-12 05:01:26.816907	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.371448	2025-09-12 05:08:50.371448
200	468	st to answer questions—it’s to learn how people interact with conversational AI and train the model. Input: a user types into an open text box with little guidance. Output: the AI responds with text. Reward: the user can copy the output, rate it up or down, ask for a regeneration, reply with a new prompt, or simply leave. The design is beautifully simple, but perfectly suited for the use case: learning from interaction at scale. Exploring Just the Input Let’s imagine a hypothetical case: “find the best restaurant near me.” There are endless ways we could design the input alone: A plain text box where the user types: “find the best restaurant near zip code 10001.” A text box with built-in suggestions to guide phrasing, paired with a hidden input that auto-detects location. A palette builder where users select favorite cuisines, plus a hidden location input that’s bundled into the prompt.	1	size	Designing for AI Interactions: Input, Output, and Reward (Part 2)	Blog Post		0.9	post_24	2025-09-12 05:01:26.816907	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.374341	2025-09-12 05:08:50.374341

Even an upload flow where users share photos of past meals they loved, combined with location detection. Each of these designs changes the interaction—and changes what the AI learns in return. The Bigger Opportunity None of this is new in principle, but what’s new is the power of today’s language models. The possibilities for interaction design are richer than ever, and our responsibility as designers is to create experiences that are transparent, valuable, and joyful. So whether you’re designing inputs, shaping outputs, or defining rewards, remember: you’re not just shaping an interface—you’re shaping how people and machines learn from one another. Have fun designing. 😃	2	size	Designing for AI Interactions: Input, Output, and Reward (Part 3)	Blog Post		0.9	post_24	2025-09-12 05:01:26.816907	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.37639	2025-09-12 05:08:50.37639
202	469	Metrics can tell you where to focus, but they can’t tell you how the work feels to a customer. Too often, teams fall into the trap of optimizing for numbers alone—pushing buttons into modals, forcing clicks, nudging behaviors—while forgetting the experience those numbers represent. I faced this head-on while leading activation design at Dropbox. The challenge wasn’t just to move the metric—it was to bring the customer back into the process. The Problem Our team’s focus was activation. Data pointed us toward opportunities like increasing team member invites. The solutions we were exploring? Growthy quick fixes, like forcing the invite button into a modal during onboarding. They might have bumped numbers, but they weren’t designed with the customer’s experience in mind. Our approach lacked customer focus, and I knew it would eventually hurt both the user journey and the business.	0	size	Designing for Customers, Not Just Metrics (Part 1)	Blog Post		0.9	post_115	2025-09-12 05:06:43.335567	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.379119	2025-09-12 05:08:50.379119

The Approach Because research bandwidth was thin, I decided to bring customer focus directly into the design team’s practice. My research partner and I asked product design ICs to take ownership of customer conversations themselves. We created a lightweight ritual: every two weeks, a design IC would lead a competitive onboarding audit. They’d share their observations with the design team, our researcher, and one or two non-design partners who would challenge assumptions. The point wasn’t to copy features—it was to extract principles from what worked elsewhere. The team drew inspiration from everywhere—Fortnite, Spotify, even the experience of getting into a Tesla. Designers then built prototypes that highlighted those principles, which we tested with users. With research support, we focused conversations on sentiment and principles , not just tasks.	1	size	Designing for Customers, Not Just Metrics (Part 2)	Blog Post		0.9	post_115	2025-09-12 05:06:43.335567	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.381847	2025-09-12 05:08:50.381847

The Principles From this ritual, the team distilled principles that became touchstones for our work: Give the customer control. Be transparent. Give more than you take. By rooting our designs in these principles, the team shifted its mindset. Instead of just asking, How do we increase invites? they started asking, How does this feel for the customer? The Results The impact was clear. Designers were more aligned. Conversations shifted from growth hacks to experiences. Our prototypes not only tested better with customers but also inspired more thoughtful debate across product and engineering. Customer centricity went from being a vague aspiration to a concrete part of the team’s everyday process. Metrics measure outcomes, but principles shape experiences. Balance both, and you get solutions that last.	2	size	Designing for Customers, Not Just Metrics (Part 3)	Blog Post		0.9	post_115	2025-09-12 05:06:43.335567	\N	2025-09-12 05:08:50.383827	2025-09-12 05:08:50.383827

426	Ways To Pivot A Product	If you've hit a point in your product when progress or growth has halted and the current path forward is no longer working, perhaps it's time for a pivot. As Eric Reis put it "a pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision." There are many different types of pivots. Some, such as a marketing pivot or channel pivot, don't involve changing your product. Others can be as drastic as stripping away all the things that aren't working, and zooming-in on only the most important feature. Here is a short list of some different pivots to get your brain flowing: ><mark>A pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision.</mark> ><small>Eric Reis</small> Customer need pivot In some cases, early on your customers might show little interest in the problem you are solving. This pivot is about rethinking the value of the problem you are solving. Perhaps it's time to solve a different problem with a completely new product. One of the most popular customer need pivots is Groupon. You've probably never heard of the website "The Point": a social good fundraising site that employed the _tipping point system_ to secure funding. When enough people promised a pledge, the funding would be secured - kind of like Kickstarter. It didn't catch on. The founder decided to pivot to a different customer need using the same concept of the _tipping point_. The Point became Groupon. A site where groups of people could hit a tipping point that would open up coupons for use. Zoom-in pivot Do you have at least one great feature? Take only the most successful feature (most used? highest grossing?) and strip away anything that isn't necessary for the success of that feature. Double-down on what has been working well, rather than trying to expand into new areas. Nokia began as a paper mill in 1865. As the company grew, they expanded what they produced, including rubber goods, electronics, and telecommunications devices. In 1992, they zoomed-in and decided to focus exclusively on their mobile devices. They sold off all other divisions of their company and rose to great success (albeit unmaintainable...) Zoom-out pivot If you have an extremely focused product and simple feature set, perhaps it's time to think about expanding into new areas and solving other problems. Dig into your customer and see if they are using your product as a compliment to other software or tools. If so, think about solving for some of the problems that those other tools solve. A great example of the zoom-out pivot is PayPal. PayPal started specifically to allow people to beam payments over handheld PDAs. It took a lot of permutations, and the merger with a financial services company, before PayPal became a payments platform. Quickly thereafter, they became the preferred online payment system for eBay and rose to glory. Customer segment pivot Perhaps your product solves an actual problem, but the customers who you've been targeting don't appreciate it the way you'd hoped they would. Was there another audience that hinted at the value of your product, but it wasn't for them? Perhaps now is a good time to try and position and optimize your product for a more appreciative segment. Business model pivot Your product may not be the problem. Perhaps your pricing model and monetization strategy are inhibiting your product from being more successful. A business model pivot is about altering your pricing model, monetization strategy, and marketing strategy to capture the most value.

422	Kill, Pivot or Preserve	==Running out of money or time can force a product team into making difficult decisions about the future of their product. The two most challenging decisions: pivot the product or kill it altogether.== To be presented with a challenging decision like this isn't rare; it might happen many times during the life of a product. At the earliest stages of a product, when the risk of running out of resources is greatest, it's important to be very critical of your path and ask yourself if you should kill, pivot or persevere every couple weeks. Typically, the first time you encounter this question, you will rely on the qualitative data from customer development. As your product grows, and you have more users, you can rely on both qualitative and quantitative data such as pirate metrics. It is very easy to always preserve, but it isn't always the best decision. ==A product is most successful when it can be looked at critically, and changes are made based on what has been learned.== Taking the time to think about the successes and failures of your product and your limited resources, will keep you thinking about your customer and priority. When to Kill The hardest decisions to make about your product is to kill it. I would love to say that a product should be killed when the team has tried everything without success, but that isn't the case. Resources will run out before you can try everything. ==If you can save your resources for a project that has more promise, you probably should.== A few questions you can ask yourself before you decide to kill the project: Do you have a continued passion for your product or vision? Can you identify exactly why your product is failing? Will more than 50% of your customers be "very disappointed" if you kill your product? Are there seeing signs of success in the future? Are there obvious pivot options that you haven't tried? Do you have enough runway (time, money, resources) to try a pivot? Will you be devastated if you kill your product? If you answered no to more than one of those questions, this product may be ready for the shelf. But obviously, even if you did answer all of those questions with a no, you might be able to justify continuing on. Don't let a stinkin' blog post sink your ship ;) When to Pivot There are many types of pivots that you can make if your product isn't succeeding. Assuming that you are not feeling enough success to continue on the same path, here are some questions you can ask yourself before deciding to pivot: Are there particular parts of your product that are being used far more than others? Are customers complaining that your product is too specific? Is there a particular customer segment that has responded better than others? Are there new channels to your customers that you haven't tried? Have you tried changing the pricing? The way you are selling your product? I.e. subscription, a la carte, etc? Have you tried focusing on different growth model? Paid, viral, referral etc? When to Preserve It is easy to choose to preserve, but it isn't always the right answer. Before you decide that you don't need to make any major changes to your products path, try asking yourself a few questions: Do you still have a passion for the vision of the product? Is the product currently meeting your goals? Is the product sustainable at this pace? If the product continues at this pace, will it exceed your goals? Do you have to defend the product to anyone on your team? Do you feel like you have put too much into the product to give up?IKEA effect The Decision Meeting In the early stages of a product, I like to run a kill, pivot or preserve meeting every 2 weeks. This is when the product is at the greatest risk of running out of money, time or resources. The meeting generally involves the presenter, the stakeholders and anyone that can help to answer questions about the data in the presentation. ==The presenter, often the founder, presents a quick summary of the last 2 weeks, then makes a recommendation to the stakeholders to kill, pivot or preserve. The stakeholders often ask questions, and then vote for or against the recommendation.== Often, you get a consensus, but if that isn't possible, you follow the majority vote or the stakeholder with the largest stake. The Agenda Review the vision of the product. Review the goals for the last 2 weeks. Talk about what was achieved, and what was learned. Present the decision about what to do next, and how the learnings have informed this decision and what steps you will take. Vote on it. The Presentation I usually create the presentation the day before or day of the meeting. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes to create. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be clear and consistent. It is a great tool to look back and see what you have tried and what you have learned. The presentations can be difficult to compile. When I sit down to start creating the presentation, I often think to myself "what did we do the last 2 weeks?" ==As I begin to prepare the presentation I am almost always wowed by what we have learned and accomplished.== My presentations are anywhere from 5 - 10 pages, and take about 10 minutes to present. A decision meeting presentation might include: Reminder of the vision of our product. Brief summary of what was accomplished in the last 2 weeks. Overview of the meaningful metrics if you are far enough along. Successes and failures, and what we learned from them. List of assumptions that have been tested, and if they were validated or invalidated. Brief summary of the budget, burn and runway. The decision to kill, pivot or preserve. A rough plan for the next 2 weeks A decision meeting can provide a lot of value. You are setting a tone of transparency. Sharing exciting findings and demonstrating progress. Uncovering new learnings and explaining the direction of the product. Celebrating successes, and illuminating failures as an opportunity to learn. ==Finally, you are keeping the team and stakeholders in the loop and vested and interested in the product.==	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_14	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	2025-09-12 02:00:28.026232	2025-09-12 05:13:03.763586	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.763586
421	Running a Lean Experiment	If you are building an app with limited time and money, experiments are a necessity. ==It is invaluable to learn what works, and what doesn't, before you invest time and money into an idea.== It's true that some people get it correct the first time. But, that is rare and risky to assume that you got it correct too. Running experiments helps you gain confidence that you are creating a _correct_ solution. In this post, I will outline the components of a Lean experiment. ==I use Lean experiments because they emphasize spending the least amount of time to build a testable solution.== Setting Up a Lean Experiment A Lean experiment follows a straightforward path: Establish your riskiest assumption Identify the customer behavior associated with that assumption Commit to a single metric you believe in Design a solution Capture your hypothesis Build the minimum viable feature/product Document the results Record your observations Add your insights Let's go more into detail about each part of a Lean experiment. Identify the Riskiest Assumption The riskiest assumption is an assumption you are making about a key-stone element of your product. You accept it as true without evidence. ==It can take form as a belief about your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about market size, and many other things.== It is best to start with the riskiest assumptions first. If we don't address this assumption, this business idea might fail. The riskiest assumption is not easy to find [1]. When trying to find your riskiest assumption, start with universal risks. Be sure to use your intuition and challenge your own assumptions. Follow up by talking with domain experts. The Customer's Action How does your riskiest assumption relate to your customer’s actions? Let’s pretend that your riskiest assumption is "customers will trust your service with their personal information". The related action is the customer giving you their personal information. When creating a Lean experiment, you want to identify an action that you can test and measure. Some examples: Choses option a over b Pays you for the product Signs up for a newsletter Comes back to the application the next day Refers a friend The best types of actions are real “currency” exchanges. This is when a person give you something of value to them. It demonstrates a high level of honesty in their action. ==The more currency that the person has to spend to complete this action, the more value we can associate with that action.== Target Metric Commit to a minimum success threshold. Choose a number high enough to get you and your team excited if true and relative to the assumption you are testing. Experiment Build the absolute minimum required to test your assumption, as fast as possible. Don’t just confirm, learn. Include ways to capture surprises as well as real behavior important to validating your business activity is successful in influencing customer behavior. Hypothesis A specific description of the customer behavior you’re measuring, your target metric and the experiment you’re running to test your assumption. If we do X, then Y% of customers will behave in way Z. Results What actually happened? Record the actual metrics generated during your experiment, paying close attention to new behaviors and surprises. For example, 50% (5/10) people behaved in way Z. Observations Why did the customer behave this way? Record the observable behavior, live feedback and reactions you witnessed firsthand, which influenced the actual results. Insights Insights change the way you think about your customers or your idea. Record the new information you generated during this experiment, as well as unique observations made in the field. Decision Was your riskiest assumption true? Look for a trend in your evidence over time. No single experiment holds all the answers. Iterate? Persevere? Pivot? If you are running many experiments it can be a good idea to create a visual map of those experiments so your team can be aware of the progress you are making [2]. Summary Remember, there is no perfect solution, but there are certainly ones that are better than others. Don't assume that you got it right. Assume that you don't know, but the people using your application will tell and show you what "right" feels like. --- Endnotes [1] https://leanstack.com/on-identifying-riskiest-assumptions/ [2] http://www.movestheneedle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rapid_Experiment_Map.pdf	Blog Post	#lean, #experimentation, #frameworks	0.9	post_13	2023-07-14 18:02:53.805307	2025-09-12 02:00:28.018943	2025-09-12 05:13:03.760991	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.760991

There are loads of buttons that help you spend money, but very few buttons to help you save. Piggy brings the save button to the forefront and helps people develop better money-saving habits one day at a time.\n  \n\n  \n    A friend and I got into a discussion about how difficult it is to save money. Our conversation shifted to how our culture is a spending culture - we are pushed to spend but not to save. In our personal lives, spending occurs daily while saving occurs bi-weekly or monthly. We are very good at spending because we practice it daily, but the opposite is true of saving. As a result, spending feels easy and seamless, while saving money feels like a chore and takes effort.\n  \n\n  \n    Moreover, we both lacked confidence in our ability to save. We felt that our spending habits were bad. We recalled that when we did have extra cash, we usually ended up spending it on socializing or unnecessary things.\n  \n\n  \n    The Problem\n  \n\n  \n    I want to save money, but my current saving habits and lack of extra cash make it very difficult to save money.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Planning\n  \n\n  \n    Our next step was to do customer discovery and see if others shared this pain. Before diving into solutions, we wanted to see if other people had a similar relationship with money. We created a short list of questions and started with 5 in-person interviews.\n  \n\n  \n    Key Findings\n  \n\n  \n    Most people desired to save more money\n    Most people spend money every day\n    Most people had spendable income\n    Half of the people said they did not have good saving habits\n    Some people said they didn't budget\n    Few people said they spend "too much"\n    Few people said they are often encouraged by others to save money\n    Few people saved directly out of their paycheck\n  \n\n  \n    These responses validated that people wanted to save money, but their saving habits were poor. However, our assumption that lack of extra cash led to difficulty saving was invalidated. We observed that extra cash wasn't viewed as money they should save, rather there was a perception that extra cash could be spent. After the interviews, we modified our problem statement:\n  \n\n  \n    Modified Problem Statement\n  \n\n  \n    I have extra money that I want to save, but I have bad saving habits.\n  \n\n  \n    At this point we felt confident that people resonated with our problem statement and decided it was time for an abbreviated design sprint.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Designing\n  \n\n  \n    Almost right away we had an interesting finding. While looking at our competition, we noticed that most existing tools were directed at helping people get context around their money. They "helped" people save by offering budgets or attempting to automate the saving process.\n  \n\n  \n    Looking at our competition was eye-opening. It didn't seem that anyone had actively focused on developing a person's saving habit. Rather, existing tools aimed to help people save money by monitoring spending habits. We kept this top of mind as we went through the sprint.\n  \n\n  \n    As we diverged, we continually found ourselves digging into the belief that: People's saving habits will be improved if we engage them in saving daily.\n  \n\n  \n    As we continued to sketch out solutions, we refined that statement further: Providing a person with daily encouragement and reminders to save their leftover spending cash will help develop better saving habits.\n  \n\n  \n    From here we developed a user journey to help guide us through building our prototype. As we refined a potential solution, we surfaced many assumptions about our users that we needed to test.\n  \n\n  \n    Key Assumptions\n  \n\n  \n    People will use one account for all daily spending\n    People want to be reminded to save money daily\n    People want the option to save\n    People will save out of spending cash, separate from bills\n  \n\n  \n    Next we set out to build a prototype to test with users. Based on the outcome from the sprint, we started to build a prototype to test that our solution was viable and addressed our riskiest assumptions.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Impact\n  \n\n  \n    We ran 7 user tests with our target market: people who made $80K+, currently wanted to save money, and felt that they had bad saving habits. We weren't entirely confident that this was our target market, but that was the group we had gotten the most positive feedback from.\n  \n\n  \n    The user tests were a great success. Not only did we uncover some interface and experience problems, but we got a lot of positive feedback and validation that being prompted to save money felt empowering and different from other tools. About half of the users asked to be notified when the application was to be released without being prompted.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Challenges\n  \n\n  \n    Before we started to develop the MVP Piggy application, we spiked on the engineering side. We quickly ran into difficult technical hurdles. The immediate problem we faced was facilitating the transfer of funds from a checking account to a savings account. We were able to find a means to do so, but at a high cost. The best solution we found would cost each user $10 per month.\n  \n\n  \n    With a cost that high, we didn't believe that our complete solution would be viable. Five options we were considering:\n  \n\n  \n    Don't have a save button, rather remind and suggest an amount to save\n    Partner with a bank to get free access to the API to facilitate money transfers\n    Find a better/free solution to facilitate money transferring\n    Create a better/free solution to facilitate money transferring\n    Get users to pay\n  \n\n  \n    We wanted to pursue the third option, while considering the first option to be our MVP. We felt that although you couldn't save money using the application, the daily reminders and encouragement would still be useful. Our end goal is to provide the means to directly save money without any charge to the customer, so option 5 is out of the picture for now. But before we could take this path we went in search of a buyer.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Learnings\n  \n\n  \n    The most interesting learning was finding the buyer. Free products are never free. If a product is free, then the user is the product. With that in mind we started to look into how helping a person save money was monetizable. Through some of my partner's connections, we were able to sit down with people from American Express and Citi Bank.\n  \n\n  \n    What we learned was obvious in hindsight. Banks pay a great deal of money to get an individual to open a checking or savings account. If we could use this app to guide people to opening an account, it was an acquisition play for the banks. Moreover, the more money a person has in their account, the more the bank can leverage that money. It's a win-win for the user and the bank.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Closing\n  \n\n  \n    The development of the Piggy application has addressed the challenge of saving money in a spending-centric culture. By actively engaging users in daily saving habits through reminders and encouragement, Piggy sets itself apart from existing tools focused on monitoring spending. User testing validated its effectiveness, receiving positive feedback. Challenges related to technical hurdles and high costs for fund transfers prompted exploration of alternative options, including partnerships with banks. The journey also revealed the potential for Piggy to serve as an acquisition tool for financial institutions. Overall, Piggy offers a practical solution to improve saving habits and benefits both users and banks.\n  \n\n	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.766097	2025-09-12 02:00:28.308262	2025-09-12 05:13:03.792024	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.792024
427	Manager or Individual Contributor 	Are you questioning which track to take as a Product Designer - Manager or Individual Contributor (IC)? Are you managing someone who is questioning which track to take? Throughout my career, I've had to make this decision personally, as well as work with colleagues that were making this decision. I've tried to support mentees, reports, and colleagues, and let me tell you, the context surrounding the decision is never the same twice. In an ADP List mentee session, I was asked for some support with the following situation: > [...] I've been working as both a product designer and a design manager. However, the scope of the product I'm working on is too big, and I can't work effectively with my team. As a result, I've had to cancel my 1:1 meetings with my direct reports and can't help them when they need my assistance. This situation is frustrating for me. I recently discussed this with my manager, and they asked me what my choice would be if the company gave me the opportunity to continue working as a design manager/lead or as an individual contributor/product designer. My goal with in that meeting, and with this post is to provide, two significant pieces of information that might help with thinking through this topic. Do Consider Are you comfortable making decisions that directly affect people's lives? The role of a manager varies, but one thing is clear: your decisions directly impact people's lives. You decide which projects they'll work on, their salary, and even their employment status. Of course being a manager has its joys: helping people develop new skills, setting them up for success, and creating opportunities are just part of the fun. However, being a manager also means making tough decisions and giving feedback. A good manager is emotionally available, able to handle difficult situations, resolve conflicts, and address issues face-to-face. If you're uncomfortable telling someone they're not performing well, reassigning them from a beloved project, or in the extreme letting them go, then being a manager may not be for you. While I don't want to focus solely on the challenges, it's important to recognize that you can't be a good manager if you're not willing to make decisions that directly affect people's lives. Do Not Consider Do you love using your technical skills? Many people claim that as a manager, you no longer need to use your technical design skills. However, it's not about using the same skills, but rather leveraging your expertise and applying your technical abilities to new areas of responsibility. Don't think of switching tracks as a waste of your acquired skills. If someone tells you that you're wasting your skills, they're only looking at the outcomes you've delivered, not considering your true potential. Moreover, if you feel that you lack the technical skills to progress in your current track, take a moment to reflect. Are you experiencing imposter syndrome, lacking motivation, or simply not ready to invest in your career? It's alright if you're not prepared to develop new skills in your current path. However, if that's the case, now may not be the right time to explore a new track. First, ensure that you understand what is inhibiting your desire to invest in yourself. Simply changing tracks isn't always reliable inspiration. In fact, it can often backfire and further hinder progress, as immediate wins may become even more scarce. Closing whether you're deciding between a Manager or Individual Contributor (IC) track or supporting someone in this decision, consider the unique context of each situation. But two things to remember; 1) if you don't want to make decisions that affect people lives directly, don't be a manager, and 2) if you're worried about wasting your technical skills, don't be. 👍	Blog Post	#management	0.9	post_27	2023-07-13 02:12:33.50214	2025-09-12 02:00:28.057349	2025-09-12 05:13:03.779705	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.779705
423	Validation with Facebook Ads 	Before you start building the world’s most awesome app, it’s a good idea to find out if people want it. I know it’s hard to believe others might not love your idea, but unfortunately, not everybody likes the same stuff. If we find out others have interest, you can avoid wasting time and money building something nobody wants. The Facebook ads experiment will give you a high-level understanding around the following: if you have a strong unique value proposition if people desire to learn more about your idea, and which audience cares the most about it <mark>This experiment will not give you proof - this experiment will give you confidence.</mark> Wouldn't it be nice to have confidence that someone other than your best friend likes your idea? The Experiment The Facebook ads experiment leverages Facebook’s large and diverse user base and its rich data about those users. With this data, you can target specific audiences and uncover the level of interest in your idea. Each experiment will involve running 2 ads to A/B test against. Each ad has a design that highlights the unique value proposition and targets a specific audience. <mark>In each experiment, you isolate a variable to uncover which one garners interest. Those variables could be the unique value proposition, design, or audience.</mark> Getting set up In order to run this experiment you will need a few things: An idea for an app. At least one Unique Value Proposition (UVP) - it’s okay to have more than one. A well-defined audience that will be using your app. A Facebook account _Optional but highly recommended: Facebook page *_ _Optional but highly recommended: Splash page _ <small> If you want your ad to appear in the Facebooks users’ news feeds, you will need a Facebook page and a website. A simple Facebook page with an image and a single post saying coming soon will cover the page. A simple splash site stating your UVP and a "coming soon" will work. </small> <small>If you do create the splash page, you could incorporate a currency exchange. This would allow people to pay or sign up to be on a waiting list. Here is an example of a somewhat in-depth splash page to test a currency exchange http://www.nillyapp.com/ </small> Running the ads To run the ads, visit https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads. You will need to log into your Facebook account to create the ads. I won’t go into great detail about how to do actually create the ads since the UI changes so often, but I will cover the main points. Ad Type Ideally, you want an ad that is meant to generate leads. You could create an ad that drives people to a Facebook page, but you wouldn’t benefit from the possible currency exchange of a splash page. Regardless of what type of ad you pick, make sure that you are charged per click. Clicks are a low-level form of validation. Audience & Placements Chose an audience that is narrow. A large vague audience makes it more difficult to determine who is interested in your idea. You have the option to run ads just on Facebook, on Instagram, or on their entire ad network. If you believe that one of those areas doesn’t apply to you, then feel free to cut it out. Just make sure that you are consistent with all the ads. Budget & Schedule Each ad should run for at least 7 days. I tend to spend about $100 to start. It's really up to you. Design & Content Design and content encompass the format, media, page, and links. You will want to create a simple ad that shows your UVP and has a call to action. Here is an example ad: !Example Facebook Ad Taking action with each test For the best results, you'll want to run at least 3 A/B tests. If the first 3 A/B tests return mixed results, you may want to run up to 6 A/B tests. I'll do my best to guide you from where to start and then based off of your results, where to go next. Determining success Bare in mind that these A/B test will return a single data point for you to compare results - clicks per impressions. You have to determine what success looks like. Different ideas should have different thresholds. If your idea is hard to execute and you need many users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be very high. If your idea is easy to execute and needs a few users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be low. Try to answer these questions to determine a success threshold: How difficult do you think it will be to execute on your idea? How many users do you think you will need to be successful? How much competition is there for your idea? What is the average lifetime value of a customer? What is the average cost for this kind of product? What is the size of your audience? Things to avoid Avoid the desire to get clicks! Keep in mind that just getting clicks isn’t going to teach you anything - you need to know why you got the clicks. This is not about advertising best practices. You can throw words like “free” and “limited time” that will encourage clicks, but we don’t want that. <mark>We want an ad that tests only the value of your idea and the audiences that see it.</mark> One of the most valuable outcomes is to identify that your idea doesn’t resonate with anybody. You save all the time and money it takes to build something nobody needs. Experiments Value proposition with style variable This test will help you identify if your unique value proposition garners interest from a particular audience. You can run a single ad by itself, but I prefer to run 2 ads with the same content but different styles. This helps create a variable and a control to use for comparison. Example: !value proposition with style variable example Variable and controls same audience (control) same unique value proposition (control) same time frame & budget (control) different aesthetic style (variable) Analyzing outcomes <mark>If both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that enough people like your idea, then you've got some validation.</mark> You can stop experimenting if you'd like, or if you want to be more thorough, you can move on to the second test: testing the audience. If one ad got way more clicks per impressions than the other, you could be concerned that the unique value proposition isn’t strong enough and that the ads visual style is what garnered the clicks. You should run a UVP A/B test to isolate the style as the enticing factor. If neither ad gets enough clicks to make you happy, you should run this test again with a different UVP. Value proposition with value proposition variable This test is to help us identify the interest of our unique value proposition. Unlike the solo UPV a/b test, here we are going to pit two UVPs against each other. This test is great to run when you have competing ideas, or when you are not sure which aspect of your idea people are most interested in. When creating this ad, make sure that the ad is simple and focuses mostly on the unique value proposition. Example: !Value proposition with value proposition variable example Variable and controls same audience (control) same time frame & budget (control) same aesthetic style (control) different unique value propositions (variable) Analyzing outcomes If one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it. If both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you might want to do two things: one - run a solo UPV test with each UVP to see if the style was the draw, or two - pick the UVP that is coupled with the least risky to execute business plan. If neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try three things: pick two completely different UVPs and run this again, try a different UVP and run the solo UVP tests, run this test again with a different audience. Value proposition with audience variable The purpose of this experiment is to determine which audience responds best to the UVP. This experiment is best if you think your UVP is great, but the audiences you have tested thus far, are the wrong audiences. This test should be run only after you have run either the value proposition with style variable or the value proposition with value proposition variable experiment. </mark> You will use the same value proposition and style for both ads, but now you’ll run them on two different audiences. It might seem that you could run only one ad this time, and compare results to the previous experiment, but we would then be creating an experiment with two variables: audience and dates the ad ran. <mark>It is important to note that dates can affect click through rates - holidays, times of the year, days of the week, can all affect click rate. </mark> It is best to have only one variable, so you should run two ads for the most accurate results. Variable and controls different audiences, one should be the same as a previous experiment (variable) same time frame & budget (control) same aesthetic style from the previous experiment (control) same unique value propositions from the previous experiment (control) Analyzing outcomes If one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it. If both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you should be good to go. You know that more than one audience resonates with your value proposition. If neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try two things: pick a completely different UVP and run this again or pick a different UVP and run the UVP test. Summary The Facebook ad experiment is a great place to start to build confidence that your idea is resonating with a larger group of people. It is by no means perfect, but it is a good tool for de-risking your product idea up front. Remember, the biggest resource you have is your own time. Be sure to take steps up front to understand if your product can be successful.

429	Leadership Lessons from Product Design	Every day working as a leader brings new challenges that make me question whether I'm doing it right. But I've learned a few things along the way—usually the hard way—that might be helpful to share. Coaching Scales Coaching creates more leaders, while dictating only creates followers. Early in my time at thoughtbot, I was given the chance to work with the Mayo Clinic. They were a powerful, detail-oriented, impactful organization. But they lacked the tech muscles—things like design thinking, agility, lean principles—that we now take for granted. As a leader, my instinct was to prove my value by demonstrating expertise. I brought in processes like the Google Ventures Design Sprint and introduced ways to validate ideas quickly. But it didn’t take long to realize I had no place being a domain expert in that room. The Mayo team had decades of medical expertise; I had deep knowledge of tech. What I didn’t have was the authority to be both. At the same time, I noticed my design partner wasn’t contributing. When I asked why, they admitted it was because they felt overshadowed—I was trying to play both the medical and tech expert, leaving them unsure of their role. That was my turning point. I had to stop leading by example and start leading by coaching. I shifted my approach: instead of positioning myself as the voice of tech, I asked my design partner to co-facilitate the sprint. Each evening we’d run a short retrospective using a simple framework: What’s the goal? What did you try that worked? What didn’t work? What will you try differently tomorrow? By giving them the space to lead and coaching them through the process, I wasn’t just solving the problem in front of us—I was building their capability to run design sprints long after this project ended. Clarity Drives Execution Empowerment without clarity isn’t leadership—it’s abdication. Setting strategy is more than understanding the product and the needs. It's setting up the team to be able to execute on the strategy by empowering through clarity. I learned this lesson while leading a project at Dropbox to rework the admin control panel. My boss had asked me to explore the area and come up with a strategy for long-term impact. I believed I was setting this up for success. I broke the work into parts—exploration, opportunity sizing, vision development—and passed it to a senior architect I trusted to lead the charge. But here’s where I failed: I didn’t wrap the work in clarity . I never gave the business context. I didn’t spell out why this mattered, how it connected to strategy, or what trade-offs might shape the outcome. Without that clarity, the architect did what any strong partner would: thorough exploration, solid research, and a robust vision. But the vision leaned toward expansion, not evolution, and missed critical questions about how the product might change or even deprecate. The result? The project eventually got derailed and had to be reset. The lesson was sharp and clear: it’s not enough to delegate work—you have to create clarity in your asks. Why are we doing this? How will it connect to the business? What are the boundaries? Without that framing, even great work can veer off course. Now, whenever I set direction, I make sure the why is explicit. Clear context doesn’t constrain creativity—it channels it toward impact. Define Innovation Define what innovation means for your company, then build a culture around that definition. Innovation is one of those words that gets thrown around a lot, but rarely defined. For a long time, I thought it meant creating flashy, groundbreaking solutions. Over time, I’ve learned that innovation isn’t just about solutions—it’s about how you define the problems worth solving, and the culture you build around addressing them. Too often, when leaders ask for “innovation,” what they really want is something else: incremental improvements, a competitive edge, or even a whole new category. Without a shared definition, teams default to chasing shiny solutions instead of understanding the purpose behind the call for innovation. The most successful innovation I’ve seen has come when we start by clarifying what we mean. Is this about finding new problems? About defending our position in the market? About reshaping our category? Once that’s clear, you can create the conditions—a culture of exploration, constant scanning of trends and competitors, and space for people to push boundaries. Hire for Evolution and Purpose Teams that last are built by hiring for evolving roles, embracing culture add, and anchoring everything in mission. If you want to build a team that lasts, you can’t just hire for today’s gaps—you hire for the role as it will evolve. Strong teams aren’t built around temporary needs; they’re built around people who can grow with the work and with each other. One major factor of building the right team is seniority; it plays a huge role in how you think about focus, impact, and potential for attrition. Junior hires tend to desire to be generalists and built a breadth of skills. They grow into the work, take on optimizations, and support smaller projects. Their impact scales over time as they gain confidence and breadth. Their focus areas should be obvious, and there should be space for skill development. Senior and staff-level hires are different. You’re not hiring them primarily to grow; you’re hiring them to own . Their role is to take on a large, complex scope that the company knows will stay true over time. As Reid Hoffman described it, senior hires often operate on a “tour of duty”—they’re brought in to tackle a mission-critical challenge for a period of years, and to leave behind stronger foundations than they found. Another major factor is understanding the cultural needs of those you might hire. I don’t believe in “culture fit.” What lasts isn’t sameness—it’s evolution. When building a team, I ask internally "What about our culture do we want to preserve?" and "What do we want to embrace as people bring themselves into it?". And when building the team, I ask "How do you contribute to evolving a team's culture?" That’s culture add . A team that lasts is one where the culture adapts, grows, and evolves with the people who join it. Lastly, I try to hire for purpose. The most important ingredient for longevity is purpose. If you want longevity, people need to care deeply about the mission. Impact and culture alone won’t sustain a team — purpose will. When people believe in the mission, they push each other, they evolve the culture, and they build resilience through challenges. Transparency builds resilience In storms, people don’t need a flawless leader—they need an honest one. Leadership isn’t always smooth sailing. There are pivots, reorganizations, and the natural turbulence of building products. In those moments, I’ve learned that the job isn’t to have all the answers—it’s to create clarity where you can, and to be honest about what you don’t know. When our company went through a major reorganization, I felt as uncertain as anyone about what the future would hold. Instead of pretending otherwise, I focused on what I could provide: helping the team understand what was changing, what wasn’t, and how we’d keep our commitment to great design intact. In difficult moments, transparency is complex. It isn’t just about sharing everything you know; it’s about communicating in a way that provides clarity, maintains psychological safety, and respects the people affected. Timing matters. When people’s jobs or roles are on the line, transparency must come with care and urgency—you owe it to your team to treat them fairly and never leave them in limbo. The takeaway for me has been this: in times of uncertainty, transparency is generally your ally. That means preempting questions, listening for murmurs of concern, and directly addressing the fear that sits beneath so many of them: is my job at risk? You can’t always remove the uncertainty, but you can remove the silence. It wasn’t perfect, but by leaning on clarity, honesty, and timing, the team adapted. We came out stronger and more resilient—not because I had all the answers, but because we faced the uncertainty together. Ambition Has Seasons Your leadership journey maps to your ambition. Understanding its timing is what makes it sustainable. Leadership is often described as a journey, not a destination—and that’s true. But what I’ve learned is that the shape of that journey is defined by ambition. At different moments, ambition can expand or contract. Sometimes you want to push hard, take risks, and grow into the next stage. Other times, life outside of work is complex, stability matters more, or you need space to sustain yourself. In those moments, chasing constant ambition can lead to burnout, distraction, or lost impact. As a leader, I’ve had to recognize this in myself—and in my team. Not every season of someone’s career has to be about acceleration. Part of building sustainable leadership is identifying ambition correctly, embracing it at the right time, and respecting when it needs to pause. Lessons Learned Across all of these experiences, a few principles stand out: Coaching scales – Coaching creates more leaders, while dictating only creates followers. Clarity drives execution – Delegation without context isn’t empowerment; it’s drift. Define innovation – Innovation isn’t novelty, it’s cultural. Start by defining what it means in your company. Hire for evolution and purpose – Teams last when you hire for roles that grow, value culture add, and anchor in mission. Transparency builds resilience – In uncertainty, timing and honesty matter more than polish. Ambition has seasons – Not every moment requires acceleration. Sustainable leadership respects when ambition expands and when it contracts.

424	Validation with Google Keywords	One of the quickest methods to gain confidence in your product is the Google Aords Keyword Planner Tool <mark>You can leverage it to get real data that shows how often people are searching the problem you hope to solve.</mark> Example: You want to deliver emoji-cupcakes because you felt that there was a lack of bakeries that offered them. After some research, you've learned that this is true in your region. You've talked to 10 people who also feel the same way, and would love an emoji-cupcake delivery service. During your conversations with them, you also uncovered a new problem. Of those who ordered emoji-cupcakes in the past, the ordering process is complex and the variety limiting. You're feeling pretty good about this, and you want some more validation. This is where the Google Adwords Keyword Planner tool comes in. Let's run an experiment. Setting up the experiment With this experiment, we use the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool to identify: How many people are searching for "emoji-cupcake delivery" What countries/regions/states/cities is that search is most common Is there competition for this business idea To get started, define the keywords that you think are important to this search. Some suggestions: emoji-cupcake, emoji-cookie, emoji-cupcake delivery, cupcake delivery. Once you have those, check out how they fair using the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool. Analyzing the results After you run the query, you will get results that contain your keywords and related search phrases. You can use this to draw some high-level conclusions. Search Volume Search volume will give you an idea of the level of interest for each search phrase. If nobody is using your search phrases or similar search phrases, then there probably isn't much demand for the idea. Like most of these early-stage experiments, you have to determine the success threshold. Do 10k searches per month make you feel like there is a market for what you are selling? 100k? 1 million? Suggested Bid We can hypothesize that if a suggested bid is high, then a person is willing to pay for that solution/product. The idea is that advertisers are willing to pay for these ads at this high price, so they must be worth to warrant the expense. Combine this with the search volume for more insight. A high volume and high suggested bid could mean that there is a lot of people searching for a solution, and a lot of people willing to pay for it. Specificity The number of words in the search phrase can also be insightful. Let's say you tested "chores". You will probably see a lot of search volume, but we don’t really know what the user was looking for. The user could have been looking for a list, perhaps a snack called "chores". We can't be too sure. However, if we make the search phrase more specific like “how to share chores with roommates”, we have a much better idea of what problem the user is trying to solve. --- Additional Resources <small>* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qtT9o--kQ</small>	Blog Post	#process, #experimentation	0.9	post_17	2023-07-14 18:02:19.688595	2025-09-12 02:00:28.039352	2025-09-12 05:13:03.77088	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.77088
430	Turning Flat Solutions Into Impactful Ones  	When Good Work Falls Flat In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I was a Design Director overseeing teams working in new areas—freelancer tooling, admin actions—and a few of our solutions weren’t sticking. Some shipped features looked promising at first, but they didn’t make much impact. The riskiest bet was a time-tracking feature. It was polished, but it wasn’t solving anything people really cared about. My Role as Design Director This was my responsibility. Not to redesign the feature myself, but to help my team figure out why our work wasn’t landing—and to help them build the skills to avoid this trap in the future. The Real Problem When I dug in, I realized what was happening. The team was moving fast, which usually I encourage, but in this case speed had a cost. Designers were focusing on user experience details and execution, but skipping the hard part: validating value. We weren’t asking, is this the right problem? or does this solution actually matter? Effort was being measured in design hours, not in ROI. Resetting with a Framework I knew we needed a reset. I brought the designers together and shared a framework I rely on: diagnosis, principles, actions. We diagnosed the issue—too much energy on polish, not enough on value. We agreed on principles to guide us: scope to impact, show your work so feedback comes early, and break things down instead of going all in on big bets. Then we turned those into actions: identify risk up front, align on design time needed, document the process and share it with partners, and test value on medium- and large-sized projects before going too deep. How the Team Responded The team ran with it. One designer introduced lightweight “plans of action” that made our design process transparent and invited PMs in earlier. Another led concept testing sessions, bringing early user feedback into critiques before ideas hardened. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, concept tests were informing direction, and PMs were leaning in with curiosity instead of just waiting for handoffs. What Changed The shift was dramatic. Riskier projects started getting tested for value before anyone sunk months of work. Vague ideas like “time tracking” sharpened into clear problems like “help me get paid,” and then into focused solutions like “create me an invoice.” Designers weren’t just executing—they were shaping strategy. PMs began engaging more deeply in the design process, and the team itself started adding new process ideas beyond the ones I’d suggested. Our solutions got smaller, sharper, and less risky. More importantly, the team gained new habits—plans of action and concept testing—that raised the quality of design work across the board. > “When you slow down just enough to validate value, you actually speed up the path to solutions that matter.”	Blog Post	#management, #process, #leadership	0.9	post_68	2025-09-05 13:01:06.981764	2025-09-12 02:00:28.075776	2025-09-12 05:13:03.786972	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.786972
425	Blind App Review	I was recently given the prompt in an interview to "evaluate, provide feedback on creative work, and communicate improvements on design". It's a robust prompt — and it came in the form a a blind app review focused on the creative conception of a product. I love it. A big part of being a designer is being able to give critical feedback and recognize areas for improvement. I wanted to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. My goal was to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can help create a better product. Here is the approach I took: My Approach Say Hi Intro The Process Familiarize Evaluate UI/UX Analyze Brand Expression Assess Aesthetics And Taste Identify The Good And Bad Propose Changes <div class="u-padding-bottom-x-large"></div> <a name="say-hi"></a> Say Hi It’s easy to get swept up in the pressure, and challenge, of an interview - let alone a blind app review. Start off slow, say hi, and show your warmth first. Don’t forget that you're working with another person. Demonstrating your expertise is great, and showing how you include others and leverage the skills around you is a multiplier. <a name="intro-the-process"></a> Intro The Process Introduce the interviewer(s) to your process. Show them you have one, and let them follow along. <a name="familiarize"></a> Familiarize Spend some time exploring and interacting with the app. This will help you understand its functionalities, user interface (UI), and user experience (UX). What is your first impression? What are the positive aspects? What immediately jumps out that can be improved? What you think the main jobs-to-be-done or problems solved are? <a name="evaluate-ui-ux"></a> Evaluate UI/UX Assess the visual elements, layout, and overall user interface design of the app. Is the interface intuitive and easy to navigate? Are the buttons, icons, and other interactive elements clear and understandable? Does the app provide feedback and guidance to the user effectively? Does the app follow established UI/UX design principles? <a name="analyze-brand-expression"></a> Analyze Brand Expression Evaluate how well the app communicates and represents its brand. Is the branding consistent throughout the app? Does the app reflect the brand's values and tone? Does the app reflect the brand's identity? <a name="assess-aesthetics-and-taste"></a> Assess Aesthetics And Taste Evaluate the overall visual appeal and style of the app. Consider the following questions: Is the app visually pleasing and engaging? Does the color scheme, typography, and graphics enhance the user experience? Does the app align with current design trends or demonstrate a unique and innovative approach? <a name="identify-the-good-and-bad"></a> Identify The Good And Bad Based on your evaluation, pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the app. Focus on the end user experience. What aspects of the app are working well and enhancing the user experience? What aspects could be improved to make the app more user-friendly, efficient, or enjoyable? Are there any usability issues or pain points that should be addressed? <a name="propose-changes"></a> Propose Changes Offer specific recommendations for improvements based on your evaluation. <mark>Try proposing in the form of problem solving approaches as well.</mark> How would you address the identified issues or challenges? What changes would you suggest to enhance the app's UI, UX, brand expression, or aesthetics? How can the app better solve problems or meet the needs of the end user? <div class="u-padding-bottom-x-large"></div> Try to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. Your goal is to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can create a better product. 🤞	Blog Post	#process, #interviewing	0.9	post_26	2023-07-12 19:29:42.376941	2025-09-12 02:00:28.04539	2025-09-12 05:13:03.774383	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.774383
431	Fixed Position Bug on iOS	The fixed value for the position property has a very noticeable glitch in iOS9 and perhaps many other versions. ==When scrolling vertically the fixed elements can take a different position than intended.== A fixed header could settle 5 to 10 pixels from the top, or a footer might get cut off. We can fix it by establishing the height and width of the body and html and setting the overflow to auto and webkit-overflow-scrolling to touch.

434	The Action	==The second step to creating a lean experiment is identifying the user's action that that can validate or invalidate your assumption.== This action can take place in your application or completely outside of it. If your assumption states that a user needs X, what action does that user demonstrate to get X? If your users won't do Y, what action do take to avoid Y? ==Ideally you want to find a real "currency" exchange and get the user complete the action.== Something that is of value to the user. ==The user action should be measurable== otherwise you will not be able to identify success or failure of your experiment. I find it easiest to measure actions in occurrences. Examples Assumption: Our users don't trust our application with their bank information. Action: Users enter their bank information in our application. Assumption: Our users need verbal support to run further. Action: Users run further. Assumption: Our users want the convenience of a one-click grocery buy. Action: Users click a buy now button. Assumption: Users want to share their music with other users. Action: Users click a share button. Summary Try to think of the simplest action a user could take to validate or invalidate your assumption. It doesn't always have to be in your application, but typically it is more difficult to measure an action outside of your application. ==It should feel obvious to you what action a user will take that gives you validation.==	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_3	2023-07-14 18:05:10.801051	2025-09-12 02:00:28.099731	2025-09-12 02:00:28.099731	\N	\N	0.50	0.00	0.00	\N
437	Flow & Design Elements	Simply put, "flow" is a highly focused mental state. It is a level of engagement so concentrated, you don't realize that time has passed until you are out of your flow state. Mikhaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who coined the term, writes about "flow" in his book _Flow_ - first published in 1990. Csikszentmihalyi outlines the qualifications a flow state, and the conditions needed to create one. While I was reading it, it dawned on me how many conditions of flow are baked-in to good design. I am writing a more in depth post about designing for flow, but in the meantime, this post lists the qualifications and conditions of flow to consider when designing. Qualifications To experience flow, means you experience: Intense and focused concentration on the present moment Merging of action and awareness A loss of reflective self-consciousness A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity A distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered The activity as intrinsically rewarding Conditions To create a flow state, we want to look at the conditions of flow: High perceived challenges High perceived skills Knowing what to do Knowing how to do it Knowing how well you are doing Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved) Freedom from distractions Checklist Owen Schaffer, a user researcher and so much more, came up with a questionnaire we can use to understand if the person using our application is in a flow state: How much of the time did you know? | | Never | Half the time | Always | |-|-|-|-| | What to do next |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;| | How to do what you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;| | How well you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;| | Where to go next |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;| How much did you feel? | | Not at all | Somewhat | Very much | |-|-|-|-| | How challenging did this activity feel |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;| | You could overcome the challenges you faced |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;| | You were distracted from what you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;| Scoring Reverse the score of the last question to get Freedom from Distractions. The items above are in the following order: Clear What to Do, Clear How to Do it, Clear How Well Doing, Clear Where to Go, Challenge, Skill, and Freedom from Distractions. Moving On The next time you are thinking about designing a user experience, try to think about the qualifications and conditions of flow.

439	Validation Early On	In the early stages of your product journey, you won't much (if any) data that suggest your product will be a success. However, ==you should have confidence that there is a potential business behind the problem you are solving, and that other people want that problem solved.== If you feel that sense of confidence, you should continue to move forward and spend energy on gathering quantitative information that there are more than 5-10 potential customers. Think of this as high-level market research. ==We want to gather quantitative data to build more confidence that there is a market interested in your unique value proposition.== We want to put our idea in front of as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and learn if those people resonate with the problem we are solving and the unique value proposition. There are three questions we want to answer: How many potential customers identify with the problem? How many potential customers will investigate into solutions? How many potential customers will commit to a currency exchange for a solution? To answer the above questions, we can run a variety of experiments that reach a large audience, elicit a behavior from individuals that demonstrate an interest in your unique value proposition, and solicit a currency exchange from individuals in that audience to demonstrates a willingness to pay for a solution. Assuming you have already done your customer development (if not, get out of the building!), a next good step might be the Google Keywords research method. This should help you build more confidence that a larger audience is looking for a solution to the problem you want to solve. A more advanced experiment to get a far better sense of validation is the Facebook/AdWords Ad Experiment. Probably the best validation experiment you can run is the Fake Door experiment. ==Most products fail because nobody wants them.== Don't be that person - do some customer development and idea validation before you spend so much of your valuable time building something nobody is going to use.

445	Improving Solution Value	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, a couple of our solutions in emerging spaces had fallen flat. One of the riskiest bets, a time-tracking feature, absorbed design energy but failed to resonate. As a manager, my responsibility wasn’t just to help ship better solutions—it was also to help my designers grow. That meant taking a closer look at why our work was missing the mark, and how we could adjust. Diagnosing What Went Wrong What I found was simple, but telling. Designers were moving fast, but at the expense of value validation. They focused on polishing user experience while skipping over the deeper question: was this even worth building? The investment was measured only in design time, not in business or customer impact. A Framework for Change To course-correct, I leaned on a familiar framework: diagnosis, principles, actions. The diagnosis was clear—we were skipping the hard work of testing for value. The principles I introduced were designed to shift our mindset: scope to impact, show your work so others can give feedback early, and break things down before running too far ahead. The actions followed naturally: assess the risk level of each project, align on the design time required, document and share the design process, and validate value for medium-to-large efforts before committing. Putting It Into Practice One designer translated these principles into “plans of action,” lightweight but transparent documents that showed how design work would unfold. This transparency invited PMs and stakeholders in earlier and built accountability across the team. Another designer led “concept testing,” structured sessions to validate value before investing in execution. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, feedback came in earlier, and concept testing became a staple in critiques. The Shift We Saw The results were immediate. Riskier projects were tested for value upfront, leading to early pivots instead of late scrambles. Loosely defined problems sharpened into specific needs—“time tracking” reframed as “help me get paid,” which ultimately became “create me an invoice.” PMs started engaging more deeply in the design process, and designers themselves began sharing new methods, turning these initial fixes into cultural habits. Our solutions became smaller, more validated, and far less risky. > “By slowing down just enough to validate value, we actually sped up the path to solutions that mattered.” What I Took Away Looking back, I realized that frameworks give teams clarity, transparency builds accountability, and testing for value must come before polishing design. Most importantly, leadership wasn’t about having all the answers. It was about creating the conditions for the team to ask the right questions—and follow them to better outcomes.

446	Intersession Engagement Strategy	The Challenge At Grow Therapy, we identified intersession engagement as a critical strategic priority. The therapy experience couldn't just happen once a week in a one-hour session. To deliver better care, support providers, and demonstrate outcomes strong enough to maintain insurance contracts, we had to improve the quality of care that happened between sessions. The Solution Session Topics Feature We designed a system that prompted clients to reflect on their therapy experience before sessions. Key features included: Guided Reflection: Help clients who struggle with reflection AI Summarization: Convert open reflections into actionable topics Dynamic Prompting: Contextual timing based on client journey Provider Preparation: Clear, concise summaries for therapists Design Philosophy The solution focused on helping people who don't know how to reflect, rather than just serving those who already had the habit. This required: Expanding the problem space beyond simple note-taking Using exploration frameworks to generate divergent ideas Studying competitors and using AI tools for inspiration Validating why reflection was difficult in the first place Key Learnings Innovation vs. Pragmatism We championed audio-first reflection based on evidence from our Summit acquisition, but adapted when the CTO pushed back. This showed the importance of balancing innovation with organizational alignment. Strategic Pivots The feature moved between standalone and mobile app integration multiple times. Success required maintaining vision while adjusting execution strategy. Impact Measurement The initiative demonstrated that intersession engagement was not only possible but powerful, advancing care quality and supporting measurable outcomes.

452	DraftMotivating High Performers Through Scope and Strategy  	The Challenge In Q2 of 2021, I was managing a high-performing Design Manager at Dropbox—let’s call her Maya. She excelled across the board—design process, strategy, craft, and communication. She led a team of four ICs and was respected by her peers. During a career conversation, Maya shared her desire for a promotion. Promotions can be motivating, but they’re not always in a manager’s control. My job was to ensure she felt supported, that her strengths were maximized, and that we aligned her day-to-day work with what truly motivated her. My Coaching Approach When coaching high performers, I focus on three things: Understand their core motivation Give them choices that align with that motivation Connect their work to visible progress toward it With Maya, it quickly became clear that her motivation was about scope. She wanted to scale her impact in strategy and process—those were the areas that energized her. We agreed that demonstrating those skills at scale would also improve her chances of promotion, even if the timing of that outcome wasn’t fully in our control. Finding the Right Opportunities Maya and I set aside time for a working session to brainstorm ways she could stretch her scope. We both brought ideas, and ultimately we chose two: She would own a cross-group process project focused on feature validation and experimentation. She would delegate craft quality responsibilities to a senior IC, which gave that person greater influence while freeing Maya to focus on strategy. We checked with cross-functional partners to ensure alignment and adjusted Maya’s goals to reflect these new responsibilities. From there, we set up monthly check-ins to track her progress. What Happened Next Maya ran with the opportunity. She took ownership of the experimentation process, brought in two other leads, and rolled it out thoughtfully. It quickly sped up decision-making, killed projects that weren’t worth pursuing, and saved us from over-investment. Within months, the process scaled to the entire Group and was being considered for adoption across the org. At the same time, she deepened her strategic impact. She defined the solution space for users on multiple teams, and she led the strategy for bringing Dropbox into business chat apps. Delegating craft quality gave her the headroom to operate at this higher level. The Outcome Maya was motivated, happy, and visibly increasing her impact. She was leading process improvements that changed how the organization worked, while contributing strategy on high-priority projects. And as a cherry on top, she was promoted to Senior Design Manager. > “High performers don’t just need praise—they need scope that matches their ambition.”	Blog Post	#management, #coaching, #performance	0.9	post_76	2025-09-05 12:45:52.736242	2025-09-12 02:00:28.209573	2025-09-12 05:13:03.8306	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.8306
450	Turning Struggle Into Growth	In Q1 of 2020, while leading design at Dropbox, I faced one of the more difficult parts of people management: helping a talented designer who was underperforming. Over several months, I had noticed that one of my designers’ work was slipping. Their solutions were consistently overcomplicated, they were slow to deliver, and the final outputs often missed the core value we needed to ship. Confidence was waning, and feedback from peers reflected the same struggles. Previous attempts to coach them back on track hadn’t stuck, and eventually they received a low review score and landed on a formal performance plan. As their manager, it was my responsibility to ensure Dropbox maintained a high-quality design bar. But equally, I felt responsible for their growth, morale, and clarity. The challenge was clear: I had to balance empathy for the individual with accountability to the team and company. Getting to the Root Cause I began with a direct conversation, not just to deliver feedback but to invite their own perspective. My goal was to align our perceptions of what wasn’t working. When we sat down, they shared that motivation was the deeper issue. They didn’t feel energized by their current projects — smaller, incremental improvements — and longed instead for big, sweeping feature launches. In their mind, impact meant scale. This insight reframed the problem. The gap wasn’t only skill or output; it was motivation. Reframing the Work We talked openly about how to approach the situation differently. Instead of focusing on one large project, I encouraged them to view smaller projects as opportunities to ship quickly, build momentum, and practice restraint. Constraints, in this case, could be empowering. I asked them to design their own improvement plan: specific skills to work on, clear milestones, and goals tied to the team’s roadmap. Together, we agreed on shorter timelines and limited exploration for each project, ensuring they stayed focused. I committed to weekly check-ins and made sure to gather peer feedback so they could see where they were improving. The Turnaround Over the next three months, their approach shifted. With tighter timelines and smaller scopes, they moved faster, delivered simpler solutions, and regained confidence. Their performance improved enough to come off the performance plan. The team benefitted as well: solution quality rose, and we shipped more consistently. But while performance improved, their motivations didn’t change. They still felt underutilized focusing on smaller projects. After six months, they decided to leave Dropbox for a role better aligned with their passions. What I Learned This experience taught me that performance management is as much about understanding motivation as it is about addressing skill gaps. By reframing the work and creating constraints, I was able to help this designer improve in the short term and leave on better terms in the long run. For the business, it was a win: we shipped stronger work and maintained momentum during a critical period. For the designer, it was also a win: they left with clarity about what truly motivated them, and a chance to pursue work that better fit their strengths. Not every performance story ends in long-term retention. Sometimes success looks like coaching someone through a rough patch, holding them accountable, and ultimately helping them find the right environment where they can thrive. That’s a reality of leadership — and one of the hardest but most important responsibilities of being a manager.

454	From Ineffective to Inspired	The Challenge In Q1 of 2021, I returned from paternity leave to a newly formed group of about 70 people. Our focus was onboarding, activation, and the Teams SKU. A few months in, more strategic operational reviews made something clear: we were running out of valuable problems to solve. In about six months, the roadmap would hit a cliff. That gap threatened morale for roughly 25 people—including three designers—and risked stalling our momentum. Without intervention, we’d be shipping solutions that technically met goals but lacked real impact. My Role I wasn’t directly responsible for the roadmap, but I was accountable for my team’s performance, morale, and attrition. If we didn’t find meaningful work, it would hurt both our solutions and our people. Creating Vision Sprints To tackle the problem, I proposed leading a structured effort to generate new opportunities. I organized working sessions with Product Design Manager colleagues, brought in PM partners, researchers, and IC designers, and set the goal of surfacing big ideas quickly. After a few days of collaboration and interviews, I formalized a new ritual: vision sprints. These week-long sprints reserved time for discovery methods, identifying unanswered questions, and exploring big-picture opportunities. I operationalized the ritual by setting expectations with design leads and their partners, then delegated ownership of the sprints to them. Together, we created a detailed day-by-day process. The design leads went on to run three separate vision sprints, each generating a pipeline of ideas. > “After a few days of interviews and collaboration, I created a ‘vision sprints’ ritual.” The Outcome The sprints delivered a list of opportunities, each with different levels of validation. Data science, research, and PMM partners helped apply high-level sizing, which guided us in deciding which ideas to experiment with, research further, or cut. The result was a refreshed, longer-term roadmap that restored momentum and focus. Even more, the vision sprint ritual proved valuable enough that it became part of our process—we repeated it twice yearly to keep the pipeline of opportunities alive. Key Lessons Even high-performing teams can stall if the opportunity pipeline runs dry. Structured rituals like vision sprints create space for strategic thinking. Delegating ownership to design leads builds both alignment and momentum. --- TL;DR (Audio-Ready Script) > Navigate-To Button TL;DR How I introduced vision sprints at Dropbox to keep teams inspired and strategic when the roadmap ran dry.

453	Getting Design Involved in Strategy  	Getting Design Involved in Strategy How We Shifted Growth Work From Optimizations to Impactful Projects at Dropbox The Challenge In Q2 of 2019, I was leading a Growth team at Dropbox focused on onboarding and marketing. We had three designers serving Growth Managers, and while the work was shipping, it wasn’t hitting the mark. ROI was low, and the designers were becoming demotivated. The data told the same story: we had hit a ceiling with our optimizations. Moving buttons and running endless A/B tests could only get us so far. Meanwhile, lead meetings and 1:1s made it clear—design wasn’t contributing strategically, and the team’s energy was draining. My Role As Design Manager, I needed to ensure that the solutions we shipped were impactful, that the designers on my team were growing, and that we were moving from a service model to embedded, strategic partners. Resetting the Approach I started by diagnosing the issues: optimizations weren’t addressing real customer problems, designers were overloaded, and research was limited to evaluation rather than discovery. From there, I set two principles: Reserve time for bigger thinking Define problems collaboratively I aligned with my PM and Engineering partners and shifted our researcher to focus on foundational work. We sponsored a new study to uncover the unmet needs of people who abandoned onboarding. We knew when and where they dropped off—but not why. In parallel, I invested in usability tooling and process upgrades, and I carved out time for designers to think beyond incremental changes: one designer dedicated 20% of their time to future-focused work, while the other two committed 10% for two quarters. What We Found The research came back with striking insights. Half of the people who quit couldn’t identify which product they had tried. Many had landed in the Business SKU when they wanted something simpler—an expensive mismatch that didn’t meet their needs. Armed with this insight, the designer who had future-focused time proposed a “right-sizing” solution: guiding users to the product that actually fit their needs. That project ran for about a year, reshaping how we matched customers to SKUs. It also spawned related initiatives—upgrade and downgrade flows, and even how we approached subscription cancellation. The partnership between design and product on that work became a model for collaboration across the org. The Outcome By listening to designer sentiment, digging into the data, and sponsoring the right research, we were able to get design involved in strategy in a meaningful way. The designers were more engaged, their contributions grew in impact, and the company benefited from more thoughtful activation and acquisition solutions. > “We knew when and where they quit—but not why.”	Blog Post	#design, #productdesign, #uxr, #impact	0.9	post_77	2025-09-05 13:02:50.893903	2025-09-12 02:00:28.215495	2025-09-12 05:13:03.832841	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.832841
451	Managing Performance With Empathy	The Challenge In early 2020, I noticed one of my designers struggling. Their solutions were overly complex and often missed the core value of the problem. Feedback from peers confirmed what I was seeing: they tended to overthink, move slowly, and deliver work that didn’t land. The decline in confidence showed up in reviews as well, leading to a low performance score and eventually a performance plan. As their manager, it was my responsibility not just to hold the bar on quality, but to support this person as a designer and as a teammate. Getting to the Root We sat down to talk openly about their performance. I presented the feedback I’d gathered, but more importantly, I asked them to share their perspective. I wanted us to align on expectations and uncover what was really going on. What emerged was motivation. They weren’t excited by small, incremental improvements. What they wanted was to build big, impactful features in nascent areas—fast. But when the reality of their work didn’t match that vision, they lost energy and fell into overcomplication. Reframing the Work Together, we reframed the challenge. Instead of waiting for one big, perfect project, we set up a structure around smaller ones. I asked them to create a plan that addressed their challenges directly, with goals, milestones, and specific skills to improve. The biggest change was introducing tighter timelines and limiting exploration for smaller projects. This gave them constraints to work within and a chance to build momentum. I ensured their milestones aligned with the team’s roadmap and held weekly check-ins to track progress. We also built in feedback loops so they could hear directly how their work was landing. The Outcome The change was noticeable. Within three months, their speed and quality improved. They used the tighter timelines as a motivator and successfully got out of their performance plan. The team benefited as well—solution quality went up, and we shipped more. But while performance improved, motivation didn’t. They still felt underutilized by focusing on smaller projects. We tried to create opportunities for them to work on larger initiatives, but we couldn’t find the right fit inside Dropbox. Six months later, they left for a role that better matched their aspirations. What I Learned This experience reinforced two truths of management. First, that structure, constraints, and direct feedback can help someone turn performance around. And second, that motivation matters as much as skill. Sometimes, even if you can fix performance, you can’t fix fit. > “You can help someone meet expectations, but if their motivations don’t align, the success may only be temporary.”	Blog Post	#management, #sustainability, #coaching	0.9	post_75	2025-09-05 12:35:59.190215	2025-09-12 02:00:28.203496	2025-09-12 05:13:03.827982	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.827982
459	Building Strong Relationships Between Engineering and Design  	The Foundation In my experience, the two tactics that have worked best in forging strong engineering–design relationships are investing in shared language and practicing inclusion. Shared language means we can talk clearly about the same constraints, trade-offs, and technical challenges. Inclusion means giving engineers a voice in product and design strategy—not just inviting them to the meeting, but making real space for them to contribute. Over time, I’ve developed a simple framework for building impactful relationships: Set expectations Understand each other’s motivators Achieve together > “The best engineering relationships I’ve had were never about the delegation of solutions. They were about understanding one another and sharing a worldview.” Step 1: Set Expectations When Alex (not his real name) joined my team as a new engineering manager, my PM partner Nina (also not her real name) and I already had a rhythm for bi-weekly strategy sessions. From the beginning, I made it clear that Alex would be included in these sessions—not just to observe, but to participate. That expectation set the tone: he wasn’t just there to execute, he was there to shape strategy with us. Step 2: Understand Motivators Rather than rushing him into process, I spent time learning what motivated Alex. What did he care about? Where did he find energy? What did he see as his responsibility? It became clear that efficiency and scale were what lit him up. As an engineering leader, he wanted to make systems run better and remove waste. That gave us an opening to align strategy with his core motivators. Step 3: Achieve Together Strategically, we identified a major opportunity: migrating from two code bases to one. It was exactly the kind of efficiency play Alex cared about, but instead of treating it as an engineering clean-up task, we reframed it as a product initiative. Together, we sized the impact from the customer, product, and business perspectives. That framing energized Alex. He saw the initiative not just as engineering work, but as strategic impact. We delivered it as a team, reducing engineering time, simplifying maintenance, and freeing capacity. More importantly, we built trust. With that trust in place, I was able to ask Alex for support in other areas, and he leaned in with confidence. What began as an onboarding moment became a long-term partnership. The Outcome The technical win was consolidating code bases, but the real outcome was the relationship. Alex shifted from a new manager with little strategy experience to a true partner in shaping our roadmap. The framework—set expectations, understand motivators, achieve together—helped us build a foundation that carried forward into everything we did as a leadership team. --- TL;DR (Audio-Ready Script) > Strong engineering–design relationships start with three steps: set expectations, understand motivators, and achieve together. When Alex joined my team as a new engineering manager, I made it clear he’d be part of strategy, not just execution. I took time to learn what motivated him—efficiency and scale—and together we identified a big initiative: migrating two code bases into one. We framed it as a product initiative, delivered it together, and built trust. The result was a stronger product, a more efficient system, and a lasting partnership. Navigate-To Button TL;DR How I built a strong partnership with a new engineering manager using a simple framework: set expectations, understand motivators, achieve together. --- STAR Version (Bulleted) Situation 2019: new engineering manager, Alex (not his real name), joined my team. My PM partner Nina (also not her real name) and I had bi-weekly strategy rituals. Alex had little prior exposure to product strategy—his focus had been execution. Task Integrate Alex into our leadership trio. Build a strong relationship rooted in trust and strategy, not just delivery. Help him contribute meaningfully to product and design decisions. Action Set expectations: made it clear Alex would participate in strategy sessions. Understand motivators: learned he cared deeply about efficiency and scale. Achieve together: identified a code base migration, framed it as a product initiative, and sized impact across customer, product, and business lenses. Delivered the initiative and built momentum for deeper partnership. Result Migration reduced engineering time and simplified maintenance. Alex became motivated and engaged as a strategy partner. Trust deepened, and our leadership trio became stronger and more effective.

In just one week, we built\n    and shipped a prototype, tested it with users in Japan and Indonesia, won an\n    award, and progressed towards securing funding and a patent.\n  \n\n  \n    Our Head of International Research, \n    \n    Jen DiZio,\n    conducted extensive research on global work habits and tools, drawing from\n    her experience at Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. We discovered that over\n    2.5 billion people worldwide use chat apps daily, with over 1 billion using\n    them for work. Interestingly, most users rely on consumer chat apps like\n    Line, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger, rather than dedicated work apps like\n    Slack or Teams.\n  \n\n  \n    We identified key pain points through user feedback and quantitative\n    studies, finding three features that were deemed "most important" by over\n    80% of respondents.\n  \n\n  \n    Top 3 Existing Needs\n  \n\n  \n    \n      Storing files across multiple conversations.\n    \n    \n      Searching for files across multiple conversations.\n    \n    \n      Storing comments and decisions across multiple conversations.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    After a significant competitive audit, we recognized that no one was\n    directly addressing these customers' needs while meeting them where they\n    are. Consumer apps like Line prioritized personal conversations, while work\n    apps like Slack avoided the personal aspect. Both aimed to pull users away\n    from consumer chat apps into their own apps. However, SMBs and freelancers\n    outside the US, prefered to keep work and personal communication integrated,\n    leading to the use of multiple chat apps simultaneously. This discrepancy\n    created an opportunity, which is where Dropbox Flow came in.\n  \n\n  \n    Background Slides\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    &lt;% (1..22).each do |index| %&gt;\n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/dropbox-flow-background-slide-#{index}.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n      \n    &lt;% end %&gt;\n  \n\n  &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Planning\n  \n\n  \n    During Fall Hack week in 2019, we set out to solve these problems with one\n    making sure to follow our only principle: "meet the users where they are."\n    I put together a small cross functional team to take advantage of the\n    opporunity we saw infront of us.\n  \n\n  \n    Contributors\n  \n\n  \n    Owner, Design\n    \n      \n        Jason Ramirez (me)\n      \n    \n\n    Research\n    \n      \n        Jen DiZio\n      \n    \n\n    Product\n    \n      \n        EJ Reckers\n      \n    \n\n    Design\n    \n      \n        Ming Li\n      \n    \n\n    Engineering\n    \n      \n        Yenchi Linn\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    Designing\n  \n\n  \n    We built a prototype that solved for our user's problems and tested it with\n    potential customers in Japan and Taiwan.

They were\n    excited and the validation was promising. Our next step was to put together\n    a pitch to request funding to start on an MVP. Our MVP launch would start\n    with 4 in-chat features and 5 out-of-chat workspace features. These features\n    focused on the 3-big needs: storing files across multiple\n    chats, searching for files across multiple chats,\n    capturing important decisions.\n  \n\n  \n    In-Chat MVP Feature Set\n  \n\n  \n    \n      Add Flow from a conversation.\n    \n    \n      Connect a conversation to a workspace.\n    \n    \n      Automatically store files to a workspace.\n    \n    \n      Capture important decisions.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    For greater control, we have 5 workspace features.\n  \n\n  \n    Flow App Experience\n  \n\n  \n    \n      Setup and organize a workspace.\n    \n    \n      Add multiple conversations to a workspace.\n    \n    \n      Search across conversations and workspaces.\n    \n    \n      View, preview and retrieve content.\n    \n    \n      Share content in a conversation.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    Our MVP tackled the major pain points we'd heard our customers say.

This mindset expanded to other ideas,\n    focusing on supporting customers within their existing workflows. We pitched\n    a series of fast-follow concepts, leveraging browser extensions, app\n    integrations, and methods like email to Dropbox, avoiding the need for a new\n    app.\n  \n\n  \n    The prototype, validation, and pitch secured 6 months of funding from\n    Dropbox's internal incubator, Dynamo, for a team of 4 members. We assembled\n    a cross-functional team to drive the project towards its first milestone.\n  \n\n  \n    As a result of our work, we successfully applied for and were granted a\n    patent. The legal team at Dropbox supported us in filing for a patent for\n    our cloud-based storage solution bridging a chat application. We received\n    the patent in 2020.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    The Challenges\n  \n\n  \n    Within 3 weeks of securing funding, I went on paternity leave and the lead\n    Product Manager, EJ, left Dropbox. As a result, the project lacked inspired\n    leadership and expertise to drive it forward. We attempted to establish a\n    contingency plan, but it became evident that the necessary skill level was\n    not readily available within Dropbox. Consequently, the project funding was\n    redirected to a different project with a tangential value proposition, and\n    our project officially transitioned away from its original purpose.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Learnings\n  \n\n  \n    Our biggest failure was the lack of a solid plan for continued leadership.\n    Despite being aware of my upcoming leave and the Product Manager's\n    departure, we failed to adequately staff the project or identify alternative\n    leadership to ensure progress towards our first milestone. It was a valuable\n    lesson in the importance of proactive planning to maintain leadership and\n    momentum.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Closing\n  \n\n  \n    During Dropbox's 2019 summer hackweek, our team pursued an opportunity\n    identified by our Head of International Research. We built and shipped a\n    prototype, tested it with users in Japan and Indonesia, won an award, and\n    made progress towards funding and a patent. Our project aimed to address key\n    pain points in chat app usage for work, bridging the gap between consumer\n    and dedicated work apps.\n  \n\n  \n    The impact of our work was evident as we secured funding from Dropbox's\n    internal incubator and successfully applied for a patent. Our project\n    contributed to a mindset shift within Dropbox, emphasizing the importance of\n    meeting customers where they are and supporting them within their existing\n    workflows. Although we faced challenges with leadership and staffing, this\n    experience taught us valuable lessons about proactive planning and\n    sustaining momentum.\n  \n\n	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_dropbox_keeping_flow.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.76044	2025-09-12 02:00:28.27069	2025-09-12 05:13:03.842063	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.842063

That product would be OnPar; an educational game to improve the continuing education methods for doctors, nurses and residents. This is the story of how we built the product and helped the Mayo Clinic build an innovation practice.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Planning\n  \n\n  \n    In our discovery phase with Mayo, we uncovered a key problem: current continuing education methods for doctors, nurses and residents were not engaging, expensive to produce, and only mildly effective.\n  \n\n  \n    With these insights, I created a customer development interview template and interviewed about 25 healthcare professionals and related stakeholders. The continuing education space had existing competition, but qualitative research supported our assumptions about engagement, expense, and effectiveness issues.\n  \n\n  \n    As the project lead, I took on multiple responsibilities:\n  \n\n  \n    Lead and execute customer development and research\n    Facilitate solution exploration and testing\n    Lead interface and experience design\n    Establish experiment process, setup and analysis\n    Develop the product roadmap and manage the project\n    Communicate with, align, and present to stakeholders\n    Build, manage, and mentor the design team\n  \n\n  \n    As with most successful projects, it takes a village.

This was used to demonstrate the\n      similarities to design thinking and\n      get alignment on using the process\n      for vague problem spaces.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Designing\n  \n\n  \n    For our first sprint, we tested on a card game as a solution. We\n    incorporated elements we'd heard from our target customers about what might\n    engage them: solving real cases, pitting doctors against an expert\n    clinician, and professionalism. The initial prototype was a physical card\n    game made using index cards.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-prototype.png" %&gt;\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    We set out to test the card game with 15 doctors in the Mayo Clinic. We\n    ended up testing it with around 40. Doctors were not only eager to play, but\n    they were finding other doctors in the clinic to share their experience\n    with, and recommend they play. We had real world referrals to a prototype.\n    Aside for the engaement, the game answered many of our assumptions and\n    helped us understand short term needs and a potential long term direction.\n  \n\n  \n    Our next task\n    was to create a simple digital version of the game and get it out to our\n    target customers to get more feedback. Our team had proficient \n    &lt;%= link_to "Ember", "https://emberjs.com", target: :blank %&gt;\n    engineers, and capable of building powerful javascript apps ripe\n    with interaction, so we decided we'd build a web based app..\n  \n\n  \n    We prioritized a mobile platform as continuing education \n    for doctors was generally done "between things". Often times on a commute, \n    or between appointments. But rarely was this work done at home. When \n    doctors got home, they were tired and wanted to rest.\n  \n\n  \n    Here is the case picking screen. You'll notice the first version is quite\n    bare bones, but offers a few "nice-to-have" features our test groups asked\n    for; the last score a doctor got was displayed, and unplayed cases were\n    separated.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-case-picker-v1.png" %&gt;\n      \n        Version 1 of the case selection screen. Allowing users to pick a case,\n        view par for that case, and get a little detail as to the patient\n        presenting.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-case-picker-v4.png" %&gt;\n      \n        Version 4 showing how we emphaised "real case" to drive engagement, \n        leveraged the Mayo logo to build trust and drive retention, and finally\n        highlighted par to drive more engagement.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n    By version 4, we'd made many changes to the case picking screen.\n    The words “real case” meant a lot to the users, so we \n    emphasizing it. By doing so we saw an increase in the number\n    of cases started. However, it also\n    caused a a small reduction in retention. It turns the users now had\n    concerns about PHI (Protected Health Information). We later\n    addressed this on the "meet the patient" screen. \n    Another change was using the Mayo Logo to improve trust.\n    Adding it showed an increase in cases started and retention.\n    Finally, we highlighted "par" (the score to beat) for each case.\n    Doctors told us they were very competitive, and emphasizing the score\n    signaled what to beat. We saw an increase in cases started with\n    lower par numbers, and a reduction of cases started with higher par numbers.\n  \n\n  \n    Another important aspect of the game was being introduced to the patient. We\n    followed the\n    &lt;%= link_to "Grand Rounds",\n      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_rounds", target: :blank %&gt;\n    methodology and maintined that language. On the screen there is an image of\n    a patient, and some basic information about that patient. From here the user\n    goes on to ask questions to this patient.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-patient-information-v1.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n\n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-patient-information-v3.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n  &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n    The initial version uncovered some significant learnings; people were\n    concerned the case might contain PHI (Protected Health Information), images\n    of people were not helpful unless providing diagnostic clues, and finally\n    proper domain language was a must. In our iterations, we addressed these\n    issues in several ways. We highlighted the fact that we removed any PHE. We\n    removed all of the images of people and only used relevant information. And\n    finally, we updated all of our language to be domain language\n  \n\n  \n    After meeting the patient, we were on to game play.\n    Asking a question (playing a card) added 1 to your score.\n    You'd ask a question by dragging a card to the playing field (middle).\n    Once a question was asked, the card would flip, and the answer exposed.\n    You could freely page through all the questions, and diagnose\n    the patient whenever you wanted..\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-play-v1.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n\n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-play-v5.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n  &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n    Through interviews and data we learned a lot, and made adjustments. Doctors\n    were not happy that all questions had the same cost to play - they felt some\n    questions or test should cost more. Adding variable costs to cards increased\n    retention. Our original game mechanics were janky; it wasn't obvious where\n    to drop the card, once you'd asked 4 questions it was nearly impossible to\n    scroll up, and not being able to easily revisit the patient information\n    provided uneccesary friction.\n  \n\n  \n    The climax of the game was the diagnosis screen.\n    Here was the chance for the user to make their diagnosis and\n    solve the case.\n    The original screen was quite simple,\n    the user could see par, review the questions they asked,\n    and make a diagnosis. Once they made the diagnosis, they were\n    either correct and celebrated, or wrong and shown the correct answer.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-diagnose-v1.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n\n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-diagnose-v4.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n  &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n    During our in-person interviews there were a lot of “I knew its” and “oh no,\n    it can’t be that” on this screen. There was a lot of emotion from the \n    users. The question most often asked when the diagnosis was wrong was\n    "how did the expert do it?". They were curious what questions would\n    have been a better line of thought.\n    The biggest win we had in the product was adding adding a section\n    that showed the line of questioning an expert took to solve it.\n    By adding this, we say a significant increase in cases played and\n    overall retention.\n  \n\n  \n    Ultimately the iterations proved successful as we saw\n    steady engagement, an upwards trend in acquisition,\n    good 30 day retention (adding new cases was the only driver of\n    continued retention), and signal of customers willing to pay.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    The Impact\n  \n\n  \n    After extensive testing and pivoting, we discovered a successful business\n    model for OnPar. Our shift from targeting individual users to focusing on\n    those invested in learning and credentialing led us to two types of paying\n    customers.\n  \n\n  \n    Firstly, nurse organizations desired our platform for ongoing education,\n    curated content dissemination, and tracking participant engagement.\n  \n\n  \n    Secondly, larger organizations like the CDC saw the value in leveraging our\n    platform for urgent messaging, improved communication, and more accurate\n    tracking compared to their existing systems.\n  \n\n  \n    These distinct customer perspectives guided our final pivot, resulting in a\n    problem-solution fit and a group of paying customers. Moreover, the Mayo\n    Clinic team gained valuable insights in product development,\n    decision-making, customer engagement, iteration, and innovation. This\n    successful product launch marked the establishment of the Mayo Clinic's\n    digital innovation lab.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    The Challenges\n  \n\n  \n    The biggest challenge with this project was changing the mindset of the Mayo\n    Clinic from shipping something perfect, to shipping something to learn. The\n    two things we struggle with was shipping something scrappy under the Mayo\n    brand, and keeping the board aligned with learning as progress. We focused\n    on metrics often to show progress, but struggled with expressing how\n    important the qualitative learnings were, and that a failed version of an\n    A/B test was a path forward, not a set back. This took a lot of hand\n    holding, weekly meetings, and education. I leveraged the \n    &lt;%= link_to "Stop, Pivot, or Preserve framework", post_path(14) %&gt;\n    framework to disclose learings and progress, as well as force\n    alignment and decision making as a team.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Learnings\n  \n\n  \n    Our key realization was that we initially targeted the wrong paying customer\n    for the project. While doctors and residents found value in the product,\n    they were reluctant to pay for it. Nurses were willing to pay, but we\n    couldn't sustain their engagement beyond 60 days. Ultimately, department\n    heads emerged as the paying customer, benefiting from the product's insights\n    into residents and nurses, enabling them to address knowledge gaps and track\n    performance in their organizations.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Closing\n  \n\n  \n    The collaboration between thoughtbot and the Mayo Clinic resulted in OnPar,\n    an innovative educational game for healthcare professionals. Through a lean\n    product approach and iterative design, the team addressed the shortcomings\n    of traditional continuing education methods. OnPar successfully launched,\n    attracting paying customers such as nurse organizations and larger\n    institutions like the CDC. project established the Mayo Clinic's digital\n    innovation lab and provided valuable insights into product development,\n    customer engagement, and innovation in healthcare. OnPar represents a\n    cultural shift in the Mayo Clinic.\n  \n\n	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_mayo_gamifying_medical_education.html.erb	2025-09-05 01:22:30.764243	2025-09-12 02:00:28.296924	2025-09-12 05:13:03.844235	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.844235
465	What Makes a Real MVP?	Working as a consultant, I’m always pushing for an MVP. Why? Because they’re cheaper to build, and more importantly, most people don’t actually know what to build—and they shouldn’t. Not until real users are using it, and you can clearly see and hear the value your product delivers. So, let’s chat about an MVP—a minimum viable product. An MVP should be three things: The least amount of features needed to get the job done. A journey that people can complete without so much frustration they give up. Something that adds real value. The IKEA Bed Analogy Let’s say you need a bed. If I ship you an IKEA MALM bed frame with no instructions, could you build it and have a comfy place to sleep? Sure—but with a lot of anguish. That version checks boxes one and three: it’s minimal, and it provides value in the end. But it fails box two. If people give up because the journey is too hard, it’s not an MVP—it’s just an MP. Now, add some instructions. Suddenly, the same bed is achievable. The journey isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough. And that’s what makes it viable. How to Test if It’s an MVP One simple way: run a usability test. Give a user a goal and watch what happens. If they get stuck saying, “I don’t know what to do now” —and they can’t figure it out within a reasonable effort—you’ve got a problem. MVPs don’t need to be perfect, but they need to be good enough : clear, smooth, and usable, so that people can actually achieve their immediate goals and see the value. The Real Lesson Next time you’re building an MVP, don’t focus on how awesome it is. Focus on how clear it is. Because clarity is what makes something viable.

447	Creating Design Principles That Get Used	Design principles are everywhere. Most design orgs have them, but too often they sit in a Notion doc or slide deck, rarely shaping real decisions. The challenge isn’t just writing principles—it’s creating ones that teams believe in, use, and hold each other accountable to. Why Have Design Principles? Create alignment → Give teams a shared lens for making decisions, reducing subjective debates. Connect design to company ethos → Anchor design choices in the broader mission, not just aesthetics. Raise quality consistently → Define what “good” looks like so the bar isn’t left to interpretation. Accelerate decision-making → Provide a shortcut when trade-offs or conflicts arise. Scale design thinking cross-functionally → Make design values accessible to PMs, engineers, and others, not just designers. Start with Listening, Not Writing The first step isn’t drafting. It’s listening. Before any words go on the page, I’ve found it essential to run a listening tour—surveying designers, PMs, engineers, and researchers about what feels inconsistent in the work. Ask questions like: Do we feel aligned in how we make design decisions? Do our design choices reflect the company’s values and ethos? Do we have a shared understanding of what “quality” means in our work? Do disagreements in critique or product reviews often feel subjective? Do cross-functional partners understand how design makes decisions? Patterns emerge quickly, and they highlight the gaps principles can fill. Involve the Right Stakeholders Early Design principles aren’t just for designers. If they only live in critique sessions or design documentation, they won’t influence the broader product. That’s why it’s critical to involve cross-functional partners early—PMs, engineering leads, brand design, even executives. Without their buy-in, principles risk becoming “design wallpaper.” At Grow Therapy, we drafted a thoughtful set of principles: Prioritize the therapeutic relationship Support, don’t overshadow Celebrate growth, big and small Be inclusive and compassionate by design Each principle came with clear “when done right” and “when done wrong” examples, plus product tie-ins from rescheduling, reviews, and treatment plans. They were grounded in the actual problems we were solving. But here’s the hard truth: they were never adopted. Why? Because I didn’t bring the right stakeholders in early enough. Brand Design wanted to lead, but they were waiting on company-wide principles. Our VP of Product wasn’t engaged early, so alignment never solidified. We ended up in a waiting game, and the staff designer I asked to drive the effort didn’t have clear channels to get feedback and input from those who mattered most. The principles were strong. The process was weak. Choose the Right Owner Every principle needs a champion, but not a dictator. The right owner is someone who can communicate clearly, bring people along in the process, and keep the focus on collaboration over ego. Low ego, high drive, and strong facilitation skills are the traits to look for. Ownership here is about stewardship—ensuring principles evolve with the team and get used in the day-to-day. If I could go back, I’d have paired the staff designer with a more senior sponsor—someone who had visibility and credibility across leadership—to make sure the right doors got opened. > “The process of making design principles is as important as the principles themselves—it’s how you build trust in them.” Build Through Collaboration Principles can’t be handed down from on high.

469	Designing for Customers, Not Just Metrics	Metrics can tell you where to focus, but they can’t tell you how the work feels to a customer. Too often, teams fall into the trap of optimizing for numbers alone—pushing buttons into modals, forcing clicks, nudging behaviors—while forgetting the experience those numbers represent. I faced this head-on while leading activation design at Dropbox. The challenge wasn’t just to move the metric—it was to bring the customer back into the process. The Problem Our team’s focus was activation. Data pointed us toward opportunities like increasing team member invites. The solutions we were exploring? Growthy quick fixes, like forcing the invite button into a modal during onboarding. They might have bumped numbers, but they weren’t designed with the customer’s experience in mind. Our approach lacked customer focus, and I knew it would eventually hurt both the user journey and the business. The Approach Because research bandwidth was thin, I decided to bring customer focus directly into the design team’s practice. My research partner and I asked product design ICs to take ownership of customer conversations themselves. We created a lightweight ritual: every two weeks, a design IC would lead a competitive onboarding audit. They’d share their observations with the design team, our researcher, and one or two non-design partners who would challenge assumptions. The point wasn’t to copy features—it was to extract principles from what worked elsewhere. The team drew inspiration from everywhere—Fortnite, Spotify, even the experience of getting into a Tesla. Designers then built prototypes that highlighted those principles, which we tested with users. With research support, we focused conversations on sentiment and principles , not just tasks. The Principles From this ritual, the team distilled principles that became touchstones for our work: Give the customer control. Be transparent. Give more than you take. By rooting our designs in these principles, the team shifted its mindset. Instead of just asking, How do we increase invites? they started asking, How does this feel for the customer? The Results The impact was clear. Designers were more aligned. Conversations shifted from growth hacks to experiences. Our prototypes not only tested better with customers but also inspired more thoughtful debate across product and engineering. Customer centricity went from being a vague aspiration to a concrete part of the team’s everyday process. Metrics measure outcomes, but principles shape experiences. Balance both, and you get solutions that last.	Blog Post		0.9	post_115	2025-09-12 05:06:43.335567	2025-09-12 05:08:26.311092	2025-09-12 05:13:03.861769	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.861769
420	Design Sprint Map for Heroes	==The [design sprint] is a tool to identify the biggest potential risk in your product and to design a solution around it.== As a fan of the Google Ventures sprint model, I wanted to share a somewhat detailed summary of one of the first steps: the sprint map. The Sprint Map The sprint map should be done on the first day. ==This map will be your guiding light throughout the sprint process. It will help keep you on topic and your idea focused on the part of your product where you can make the biggest difference.== As an added benefit, the construction of the map will get the entire team thinking together and committed to the process. What you need: 1 hour A sprint facilitator The dedicated attention of the sprint team Whiteboard Whiteboard markers How to draw the map: The facilitator is responsible for collecting the teams thoughts on the whiteboard. They should try their best to avoid interpreting the team's thoughts, but if and when they do, they should be sure to ask the team "does this look right?". ==It is important that the facilitator makes sure that the team's thoughts are captured, and the result is not just the interpretation or ideas of the facilitator.== As the facilitator stands at the whiteboard, they should help the team through the steps of creating the map: Left to right On the far left side of the whiteboard, list the characters that will be most prominent in this story. ==I try to think of the map as the quest of a hero. There is the hero with a goal, and all of the integral characters they meet along the way.== Sometimes the story can break into side stories of the supporting characters, but in the end it revolves around our hero. Jot down the characters on the left starting with the hero. Write who they will meet along their journey in stack formation (in order top to bottom) to complete their goal. Typically there are 2-4 characters. Example: !design sprint map: step 1 Far right The far right is the goal of our hero. ==The end goal is the something that our hero is trying to attain. It is usually something tangible or service oriented.== For instance: the hero wants a meal, a bicycle route, a recommendation for the best seats at the opera. The more concise this is, the easier the map will be to create (and to be honest, the entire product). Example: !design sprint map: step 2 Map the journey The final step is to map all of the happenings between the hero and the goal. When the hero meets a key character along the way we can write this key step as the action of the key character or the overarching result of their interaction. This journey should involve all of the key characters and their role in the journey. If a key character doesn't participate in this path then they should be removed. Example: !design sprint map: step 3 Tips Keep the map simple. Try to limit the journey to no more than 20 happenings. Try to limit the amount of characters to 4 Get the group involved. Make sure the entire team is participating. As each step is drawn, ask the room "does this look right?" Don't be afraid to erase. This process is flexible. Keep erasing or writing new ideas until it feels right.

428	Raising the Bar Without Slowing Down 	The Challenge In January 2023, our design organization went through a reorg. I was leading design across 4 groups with 12 squads, supported by two managers and two senior architects. 30% of the people had joined Dropbox in the last 6 months. When I stepped back to evaluate the work, I saw issues: experiences below our quality bar, duplicative bespoke patterns, and overly designed solutions. With so many new folks learning unfamiliar surfaces, I knew the problem would only compound. My task was clear: raise the quality of solutions—without slowing the team down. The Approach We already had processes documented, and our managers were empowered to lead. So I made a conscious choice: instead of micromanaging execution, I would focus specifically on solution quality. I aligned with the managers and senior ICs to define a “quality standard” for the team. The philosophy was simple: if leadership is calibrated, we can scale feedback consistently across all squads. To reinforce the standard, we added rituals: critiques followed by leadership calibrations, a living document to capture overlapping experiences and conflicts, and plans of action that made design intent transparent and ROI-driven. We also introduced velocity tracking to ensure that our focus on quality didn’t come at the cost of speed. What Changed The results came quickly. Teams began to identify quality issues themselves, cutting down on bespoke one-offs and increasing cohesion across experiences. Designers leaned into usability testing, negative feedback dropped, and velocity actually increased. Pattern cohesion improved, connectivity across experiences strengthened, and the overall quality bar rose noticeably. Most importantly, it wasn’t me alone setting the bar—it was the managers and senior ICs pushing for specific changes and scaling that expectation across their squads. > “By aligning leadership on quality, we empowered the whole team to raise the bar—without sacrificing speed.” Key Lessons Quality scales when managers and senior ICs are calibrated and trusted to lead. Transparency through plans of action surfaces ROI trade-offs early. Velocity tracking keeps “quality” from becoming an excuse for slowing down. Standards need to be living, reinforced through rituals—not static documents. --- TL;DR (Audio-Ready Script) > Navigate-To Button TL;DR	Blog Post	#process, #quality, #leadership	0.9	post_72	2025-09-04 04:40:11.551941	2025-09-12 02:00:28.063368	2025-09-12 05:13:03.782431	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.782431
432	Breaking Out of Incrementalism	The Challenge When I first joined Dropbox, I inherited a small team of three ICs working on Onboarding. They were in the middle of a transition—from acting as a service arm to PM partners toward becoming embedded in squads. The problem was that they weren’t able to get ahead of the work. Instead of shaping strategy, they were shipping small optimizations: moving a button here, tweaking a flow there, A/B testing everything. The work was revenue-generating, but the quality and impact of solutions were starting to degrade. Watching this pattern, I realized we were heading in the wrong direction. My Role As Design Director, it was my responsibility to make sure the solutions were not only good but impactful. I also needed to motivate the team by giving them meaningful problems to solve—not just incremental tasks handed down from PMs. Resetting the Strategy I started by analyzing the reality of the situation: why were we stuck in small optimizations? My conclusion was that the team lacked a clear process to shape bigger opportunities. So I drafted a strategy framework: Draft → Identify opportunities and outline hypotheses. Align → Partner with PMs and stakeholders to ensure we were chasing the right goals. Iterate and Refine → Explore multiple design directions, not just one. Validate → Run concept testing with users to confirm value early. Execute → Deliver solutions with confidence that they mattered. I socialized this approach with PM partners, showing them how a more strategic design process could still serve business needs while unlocking bigger opportunities. The Results The shift was significant. By validating ideas earlier and aligning on impact, we moved away from low-leverage optimizations toward more meaningful improvements in onboarding. Designers felt more motivated because they were working on problems that mattered. PMs became more engaged partners, excited to test concepts and understand user value rather than just running button-placement experiments. In short, we traded “moving buttons” for solving real onboarding challenges—and design’s impact grew noticeably. > “Small optimizations keep you busy. Validating value makes you impactful.” Key Lessons Incremental work is a signal—it shows when process is broken. A clear framework creates space for bigger, more strategic solutions. Concept testing turns vague opportunities into validated problems. Aligning with PMs is critical to shifting from service work to strategic partnership.

433	Syntax Highlighting Markdown in Rails	This post is to help you add syntax highlighting to your markdown in a rails app. I prefer to use [Redcarpet] for markdown processing, and [Rouge] for syntax highlighting. This is a complete ruby solution, I believe its the [fastest], and somewhat easy to implement. Add the redcarpet Gem Add the redcarpet gem. `ruby Gemfile gem "redcarpet" ` Create MarkdownParser Class Create a MarkdownParser class to handle parsing our markdown. `ruby app/models/markdown_parser.rb class MarkdownParser require "redcarpet" def initialize(markdown) @markdown = markdown end def markdown_to_html processor.render(@markdown).html_safe end def processor Redcarpet::Markdown.new(renderer, extensions = {}) end def renderer Redcarpet::Render::HTML end end ` Add the rouge-rails Gem Add the rouge-rails gem. `ruby Gemfile gem "rouge-rails" ` Create a RougeRenderer Class Create a RougeRenderer class to handle syntax highlighting. `ruby app/models/rouge_renderer.rb class RougeRenderer < Redcarpet::Render::HTML require "rouge" require "rouge/plugins/redcarpet" include Rouge::Plugins::Redcarpet end ` Use RougeRenderer to Render Use the RougeRenderer class as the Redcarpet markdown renderer. `ruby app/models/markdown_parser.rb class MarkdownParser ... def renderer RougeRenderer.new(render_options = {}) end end ` Set Stylesheets There are a couple of ways to add the code styles to you rails app. I like to use the rouge rougify CLI command to generate a stylesheet. The CLI command should let you generate any theme found in the rouge gem's themes. For example, to generate a github stylesheet: `bash $ rougify style github > app/assets/stylesheets/github.css ` Then add it to your application.scss file. `scss // app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss @import "github"; ` You can also copy a stylesheet from here, but be aware of how the classes are scoped. You will have to set up Rogue to handle themes. Use It You can pass the markdown parser a file: `erb app/views/some_view.html.erb <% file = File.read("path/to/file.md") %> <%= MarkdownParser.new(file).markdown_to_html %> ` Or you can directly pass text to the markdown parser: `erb app/views/some_view.html.erb <%= MarkdownParser.new("#heading code {} ").markdown_to_html %> ` Resources: Redcarpet Gem Rouge Rails Gem Markdown Processing in Ruby, by Jesse Herrick Code Stylesheets from @jacobsimeon	Blog Post	#code	0.9	post_2	2023-07-12 17:59:02.152501	2025-09-12 02:00:28.093941	2025-09-12 05:13:03.797043	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.797043
435	The Assumption	==Identifying assumptions help you de-risk in your product by uncovering what might make your product fail and addressing that first.== ==An assumption is a statement you are making about your product that is accepted as true without evidence.== An assumption can take form as a belief about your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about market size, and many other things. A lean experiment should start with the assumption. ==You will want to validate/invalidate the riskiest assumptions first - the ones that if are invalidated, the product might suffer or fail.== <a id="questions"></a> Prioritizing Assumptions Prioritizing assumptions isn't always easy. I find that rating some questions about an assumption helps me identify the level of risk associated with it. ==Assign a 2 (for Yes) a 1 (for Maybe) and a 0 (for No).== The highest total is most likely your riskiest assumption. ==Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid?== ==Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this?== ==Will solving this add immediate business value?== ==Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck?== Assumption Example One Let's pretend we have a product intended to reduce the energy usage in a building by pitting tenants against each other in a competition. Our products allows tenants to see the energy usage of each apartment. The lowest energy consumer gets bragging rights. Let's look at two assumptions and score them: Tenants are willing to share their energy usage with their neighbors. [1] Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? No / 0 Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? Maybe / 1 Will solving this add immediate business value? No / 0 Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? No / 0 Competition will drive change to reduce energy consumption. [7] Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? Yes / 2 Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? Yes / 2 Will solving this add immediate business value? Maybe / 1 Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? Yes / 2 Knowing that competition actually will drive change is by far the most important idea to validate before moving forward. Without this, we don't have a product. Assumption Example Two Let's imagine we are at a later stage with the app where people are using it, but we aren't seeing a significant reduction in energy usage. Let's look at two assumptions and score them: People don't know how to reduce their energy usage. [4] Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? Yes / 2 Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? Maybe / 1 Will solving this add immediate business value? Maybe / 1 Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? No / 0 People don't understand the metric we use to compare them. [2] Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? Maybe / 1 Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? No / 0 Will solving this add immediate business value? Maybe / 1 Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? No / 0 These two score closely. The main difference is the risk we run of not solving for the first assumption. If people don't know how to reduce their energy usage, then we can never hit our goal of energy reduction and our product fails. Summary ==Identifying assumptions help you de-risk in your product.== Its best to test the riskiest assumptions first. Prioritizing assumptions is not always easy. I have found the rating these questions about an assumption helpful, but ==if you don't feel confident that the scoring is accurate enough, I urge you to dig deeper until you have the confidence that you have identified the next riskiest assumption.==	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_4	2023-07-14 18:05:17.118768	2025-09-12 02:00:28.105751	2025-09-12 05:13:03.799398	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.799398
436	The Hypothesis	The guiding light to a good experiment is the hypothesis. It is the second step to setting up an experiment, right after establishing your risky assumption. ==If you can't articulate a hypothesis, then you don't have an experiment.== ==The most straightforward and clear way to write a hypothesis is the _if_ / _then_ format.== Let's break it down. The "If" ==The if is an isolated change in the application that will lead to a desired behavior or outcome and should be coupled with your assumption.== It can be as simple as better feedback, or as complex as adding a feature. I try to write these as solutions. From there, you should be able to infer the desire or needs of the user - or better yet, a problem they are facing. Good examples: If we add a success message after... If users can chat with one-another in the application... If users can challenge one another... If there is transparency in who is rating the products... Bad examples: If we add hundreds of new products... If we make our app responsive and remove the landing page... The "Then" ==The then is focused on our desired behavior or outcome and should be measurable.== Avoid desired outcomes that deal with emotion. Although you _could_ measure how happy a person is, it is generally difficult to rely on. Good examples: Then we will get more _sign ups_. Then users will _share_ the app with each other. Then more users will participate in the forum. Bad examples: Then the users will have more fun. Then the users wont be so annoyed. Summary ==A well written hypothesis should help you understand from a high level how you are going to add value to the user, and how adding that value is going to result in a desired and measurable outcome.==	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experimentation	0.9	post_5	2023-07-14 18:05:01.427101	2025-09-12 02:00:28.111866	2025-09-12 05:13:03.801583	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.801583
438	Styling a Rails App in the Browser	As much as I love Sketh, Figma and other tools for creating interfaces, sometime designing in the browser is best. Once I have established a general layout, I like to use the browser for tweaking styles and component placement. I have no hard-and-fast rule about when to make the transition from a design tool to the browser, other than when I feel like I am making a lot of minor adjustments to my design file. At that point, it usually means that I am generally happy with the design and it's time to get a little more nitty gritty and try things out. This is also great when you aren't starting a design from scratch, rather iteration to optimize, or perhaps adding a new feature. The most cumbersome thing about designing in the browser is the tools that are available to work with. You either write the CSS locally and refresh the browser, or fidget with the browser tools to see what you like then copy that over to your CSS. However, with Guard you can write CSS as you normally would; in your text editor. When you save the file, the browser reflects the changes you made without you having to refresh the page. Installing the gem We only want Guard to be operating in our development environment. We will use: Guard Guard Livereload `ruby #Gemfile group :development do [...] gem "guard" gem "guard-livereload", require: false end ` Install the gem: ` $ bundle install ` Setting up Guard Setup guard by adding a Guard definition to our Guardfile: ` $ guard init livereload ` Setting up the browser There are a couple of ways to get Guard working in the browser; a browser extension, or middleware. I prefer using middleware, as it keeps all Guard related changes in the codebase. I use rack-liverload. Again, we only want this when we are developing, so we scope it to our development environment. Let's set it up: `ruby #Gemfile group :development do [...] gem "guard" gem "guard-livereload", require: false gem "rack-livereload" end ` Make sure to install the gem, and then restart your server ;) ` $ bundle install ` Next, let's add the middleware to our Rails middleware stack: `ruby #config/environments/development.rb MyApp::Application.configure do # ... config.middleware.insert_after ActionDispatch::Static, Rack::LiveReload end ` Using Now that you are ready to start designing in the browser, run: ` $ bundle exec guard ` By default, Guard will watch all files from / on up. When you make an edit and save it, Guard will reload your browser with the new files. Enjoy!

440	The IKEA Effect	As a Designer and Product Consultant, one of the most common traits I see in product teams is an unwillingness to throw away the things they've made. Some of the teams I've worked with celebrate removing lines of code, but ==more often then not, people believe that what they made is too valuable to throw away== (even if it can be brought back using Github, Abstract or the myriad other forms of version control.) The feeling of sunk costs comes in many forms: you might care what others think of you or that you'll regret quitting because you might be on to something. What I encounter most often is a team that feels their work is too valuable to toss. ==This is known as the IKEA effect: labor equals valuation.== The IKEA effect was coined by Michael I. Norton a, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely after conducting a study on how labor affects valuation. They captured their findings in the paper The IKEA Effect: When Labor Meets Love. The researchers set up four studies in which they had the participants assemble IKEA boxes, fold origami, and put together sets of Legos. The researchers found that participants viewed their amateur creations to have equal value to that of an expert's creation. Moreover, they expected others would feel the same. > <mark>Participants saw their amateurish creations as similar in value to experts' creations and expected others to share their opinions.</mark> > <small>Michael I.Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely</small> However, if the participants were asked to destroy their creation as part of the task, or failed to complete the assembly, the feeling of value was gone. The conclusion was that labor leads to love when labor results in successful completion of tasks, and that labor increases valuation for both “do-it-yourselfers” and novices. If you're ever on the fence about tossing a feature or throwing out some code, ask yourself if you see value in it because you built it. Don't let sunk costs sink you (sorry for that closing bit). --- Sources: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740811000829	Blog Post	#ux, #behavioralpsychology	0.9	post_20	2023-07-14 17:59:10.539672	2025-09-12 02:00:28.134958	2025-09-12 05:13:03.806373	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.806373
441	Better Meetings	Meeting fatigue is a common issue in this Virtual First world we work in. There are loads of reasons that video meetings feel taxing. What stood out to me is the actual effect that back-to-back video meetings has on your brain. Some recent research done by Zoom and Microsoft brought to light that back-to- back video meetings has a negative effect on the brain. After about 60 minutes of constant video chatting, the brain starts to react as if it’s under stress. Solution According to the research, taking 10 minute breaks between Zoom meetings has the very positive result of keeping your brain out of the stress zone. We’ve known breaks are good, but it’s not always easy to take them. My plan is simple — create a meeting culture that prioritizes breaks. Principles Start meetings late. When we end meetings early it’s easy to run over time. However people rarely show up early if you start them late. Meetings should be short. If you have 30 minutes, you’ll take 30 minutes. By constraining the duration of the meeting, you can improve the focus. You can have more productive meetings, enforce agendas, and demand decisions. Executing If you create a meeting using the principles above, the result should be: 20 minute meetings start at :10 or :40 after. 40 minute meetings start at :20 after. No 30 or 60 minute meetings. Wrap-Up Meeting fatigue is a real issue in today's virtual work environment. Back-to-back video meetings have been found to have a negative effect on the brain, causing stress and burnout. However, by taking 10-minute breaks between meetings, we can keep our brains out of the stress zone and increase productivity. To create a meeting culture that prioritizes breaks, <b>start meetings late and keep them short.</b>. By doing so, you can focus on the quality of the meeting and more easily enforce agendas and decisions. We can have more productive and efficient meetings while reducing meeting fatigue and improving our overall work performance.

442	Lego MVP Warm-up	As Product Designers we build MVPs often. To help get into the mindset of "minimum and viable" I like to play a game with a couple people that forces prioritization. This game is based off of Christoph Neiman’s I LEGO NY work. The point &mdash; use as few legos as possible to communicate an idea. Outcome !pumpkin patch !pumpkin patch !pumpkin patch !pumpkin patch Needs Legos (variety box of classic legos is ideal) Paper Solid container (hat, bucket, etc) 2+ people Pre-Game Everybody privately writes 3-5 nouns on a piece of paper Fold each piece of paper and put them into the container. Pour the legos on the table in the center of everyone. Rules Selecting what to build: Each person picks an equal number of pieces of paper from the hat. Each person blindly chooses one of the pieces of paper they have. Building: Maximum of 10 pieces can be used. For 4 minutes, everybody builds the thing they’ve chosen. Presenting and guessing: Start with any person, they present their piece. They cannot talk. Go around the table clockwise, one person at a time, guessing what the piece is. If someone gets it right, the game stops. Once everyone has guessed the game stops. *Note - if you think the person built what you added to the hat, don’t guess.

455	A Simple Framework for Building Impactful Relationships 	Strong relationships between design, engineering, and product leadership don’t happen by accident. They’re built with intention. Over time, I’ve found that the most impactful partnerships I’ve had—whether with PMs, engineers, or other leaders—follow a simple three-step framework: Set expectations Understand motivators Achieve together Step 1: Set Expectations Clarity comes first. The best relationships begin with a clear understanding of how you’ll work together. What’s expected of each role? Where are decisions made? What’s the shared rhythm? By setting expectations early, you reduce ambiguity and make sure nobody is guessing at their responsibilities. Step 2: Understand Motivators Every leader brings different motivations to the table. Some thrive on efficiency. Others care most about scale, innovation, or customer experience. Taking the time to learn what excites your partner—and what drains them—creates a foundation of trust. When you know someone’s motivators, you can align opportunities that play to their strengths and keep them engaged. Step 3: Achieve Together Nothing builds a relationship faster than shared success. Once expectations are clear and motivators are understood, the next step is to deliver something meaningful together. That achievement creates momentum, trust, and a track record you can build on. Big or small, the key is that the win is shared. You both own it. Why This Works This framework has helped me again and again—whether welcoming a new engineering manager, collaborating with a product leader, or aligning with executives. It takes relationships from transactional to strategic. It’s simple, but powerful: Set expectations so you’re aligned. Understand motivators so you’re connected. Achieve together so you’re invested. > “Relationships grow strongest when they’re built on clarity, trust, and shared wins.”	Blog Post	#teambuilding, #frameworks	0.9	post_80	2025-09-05 14:06:57.110137	2025-09-12 02:00:28.227685	2025-09-12 05:13:03.837205	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.837205
444	Turning Constraints Into Better Outcomes	The Challenge In Q3 of 2022, my team at Dropbox faced a daunting project: a new license type called “Flexible Licensing.” The initial estimate was that it would take 12–18 months to complete. Leadership wanted proof it was worth investing that kind of time and energy, but the team saw massive technical risk and leaned toward saying “no.” My job as Design Director was to break that deadlock and find a way to move forward without overcommitting. Resetting Expectations The turning point came in a meeting with area and group leads where an Engineering Manager and a Product Design Manager argued that the scope was simply too large. I immediately challenged the “no” response. With support from partners, I reframed the problem: don’t block it—scope the risk instead. That shift forced the team to articulate the specific risks and explore possible solutions rather than shutting the project down. Speed as a Strategic Constraint Instead of aiming for perfection, I challenged the team to show what they could validate in just six weeks. Speed became a constraint, not a liability. With that framing, the team identified ways to mitigate risk: launching with a small beta group rather than every platform, using design and communication to set expectations clearly, and focusing only on the most critical functionality. An Engineering Manager stepped up with a scrappy but well-thought-out plan, proving that the concept could move forward with limited investment. What We Delivered The team shipped an alpha version of Flexible Licensing to a small set of willing adopters. Designers broke the problem into manageable parts, engineers mapped out dependencies we could avoid, and together we delivered something valuable without waiting years. Some platform-specific benefits had to wait, but by narrowing scope, the timeline shrank dramatically. The alpha not only validated the concept but also gave us room to focus on quality where it mattered most. The result was a smaller, sharper, more useful solution that scaled because customers immediately found value in it. > “Constraints don’t just speed you up—they can actually make the work better.” Key Lessons Challenge assumptions instead of accepting “no.” Use constraints strategically—speed can sharpen focus. Break complex problems into parts that can be validated. Validate value before investing heavily. Leverage beta groups to learn fast. Quality often emerges from working within limits.

448	Navigating Conflicting Directives\n	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I found myself in the middle of a tension that’s common in large organizations: conflicting directives from leadership. My group was focused on collaboration within teams, spanning across the Pro SKU, Business Standard, and Enterprise. At the start of the quarter, my PM partner was advised to divest from Enterprise clients and lean toward short-term revenue. Meanwhile, my boss instructed me to go deeper into Enterprise and invest in a new admin experience. Both perspectives had merit, but they pointed us in opposite directions. Diagnosing the Conflict The misalignment surfaced in a team leads meeting. My PM partner and I compared notes and realized that what our respective leaders were asking us to prioritize didn’t line up. When we raised this misalignment, stakeholders asked us to demonstrate a feasible path forward rather than just flag the problem. Digging deeper, we uncovered a few important dynamics. A senior architect was advocating for the admin opportunity and had the ear of my boss, partly through past backchannel conversations. At the same time, company goals were clearly oriented toward short-term revenue. The disconnect wasn’t just about strategy—it was also about communication breakdowns and a lack of clear roles. Actions to Move Forward The first step was to repair communication. I sat down with the senior architect and clarified roles and responsibilities: I would remain accountable for strategy, and he would be responsible for execution. That created much-needed clarity. Next, I worked with my PM partner to reestablish priority. We were able to align stakeholders on the importance of short-term revenue, but there was no agreement on the right approach. To break the deadlock, I proposed a compromise: give the architect a three-week runway to see if the admin initiative could be broken into smaller pieces that might generate faster revenue. We allocated DS and PMM support for exploration, while also pushing forward with PMs and design leads on expanding paid security features, which had clearer near-term upside. Results and Lessons The architect ran lightweight concept testing with smaller enterprise clients, partnered with PMM for customer conversations, and collaborated with DS on data exploration. Despite the effort, we didn’t find a credible short-term revenue path. With evidence in hand, we communicated our recommendation to divest from Enterprise and refocus on nearer-term opportunities. > “Sometimes leadership isn’t about choosing a side—it’s about creating a path to test both and letting the evidence guide the decision.” This experience reinforced a few lessons for me. First, misalignment often stems from communication gaps as much as from strategy itself. Second, defining clear roles and responsibilities helps build trust and avoids power struggles. And finally, when faced with conflicting directives, creating a structured way to test assumptions not only brings clarity, it helps stakeholders feel heard—even if their preferred path isn’t the one pursued.

449	Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact	The Challenge In Q1 of 2021, activation work at Dropbox was inconsistent. My team had developed an effective strategy for helping new users get to value, but outside of our group, the approach wasn’t being used. Other teams were working on their own versions of “new user experience,” but the results weren’t impactful or aligned with the strategy we knew worked. Without adoption beyond our group, our impact was limited. My Role As a Design Director, my responsibility was to improve the outcomes of design work—not just in my team, but across the company. That meant scaling our activation thinking beyond our walls and creating a foundation others could adopt. Building the Framework The first step was to codify what worked. I drafted an activation framework that captured the principles behind our success and began socializing it with designers outside my group. To build momentum, I also started an “Onboarding Guild,” a forum where designers could seek advice on building activation solutions. Adoption was slow. Even though the framework was clear and rooted in the CCC model, most teams continued to do their own thing. I realized we needed more than documentation—we needed proof. Changing the Evangelization Strategy I asked two teams to apply the framework and capture their results. These case studies became the evidence we needed. With that in hand, I shifted my strategy: instead of sending the framework to individual designers, I started sharing it directly with cross-functional leads. I showcased team wins in relevant forums and in all-function Slack channels, making the framework’s value visible to PMs, engineers, and other stakeholders. > “Scaling a strategy across an organization isn’t about telling people what to do—it’s about showing them why it works.” The Impact With real examples and cross-functional buy-in, adoption spread. Teams that used the framework improved their activation experiences, and over time it became a standard approach across the company. The Onboarding Guild continued under new leadership, carrying the culture forward. The framework didn’t just improve design outcomes—it shaped how Dropbox thought about activation as a whole and even justified investment into a platform for pre-in-product data collection.

464	Preparing for a Creative Leadership Interview	So you’ve got a Creative Leadership interview coming up? Congrats—you’re about to be grilled (nicely) on how you think, not just what you ship. A Creative Leadership interview usually focuses on two big things: How you set direction and strategy. How you manage quality and execution. Here are a few common questions you’ll probably face—plus how I’d tackle them using the STAR method: How have you set, communicated, and evangelized strategy? (Tip: Tell a story about a moment when you had to zoom way out, bring people along, and keep everyone aligned when things got messy.) How do you ensure quality of execution on your design team? (Hint: They’re not asking if you like pretty pixels—they want to hear how you empower others, set standards, and keep velocity high.) How have you identified opportunities, operationalized initiatives, and driven your team toward impact? (Yes, it’s a mouthful. Think: spotting a gap, rallying your crew, and shipping something that moved the needle.) Closing Thought When you’re in the hot seat, keep it simple: Be concise. Use real stories. Show how you got to the outcome, not just the outcome itself. Most of all—practice out loud. It feels silly, but when you can tell your stories smoothly, you’ll come across as thoughtful and confident. Good luck out there ✨✌️	Blog Post	#leadership, #interviewing	0.9	post_28	2025-09-12 04:59:55.086886	2025-09-12 05:08:26.244188	2025-09-12 05:13:03.84679	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.84679
466	Building Product Partnerships Through Trust and Innovation	When attrition and a mid-year reorg reshuffled responsibilities in 2019, I found myself with a new product lead, someone I’d never worked with before. Let’s call her Dana. Dana was known for her execution-focused approach, while I came in with a design background full of 0→1 experience. We were different, and that could have gone either way. Setting Expectations Together The first thing I suggested was collaborative expectation-setting. Instead of me writing a list of responsibilities and Dana doing the same, we did it together. We wrote down everything we thought we owned, then compared notes to find gaps and overlaps. That gave us not just alignment, but a shared language for how we’d work. From there, I leaned on a simple framework I use for new partnerships: understand, achieve, grow . First, get to know each other’s motivators. Next, pick a project to knock out together. Finally, support each other’s growth. Finding Shared Motivators In those early strategy sessions, I learned Dana had a passion for innovation. She wanted to take bigger risks. That opened the door. I shared some of my favorite design tools—Design Sprints, Forum Traversing, Ritual Dissent—and we started to imagine what “innovation practice” could look like in our area. Instead of me leading, we decided to experiment together. We piloted a variation on the GV Design Sprint with two teams. The results were both actionable and morale-boosting. Dana was energized, and so was I. From Experiments to Practice One experiment led to another. We introduced new exercises, piloted an “innovation week,” and eventually made it a quarterly ritual. Dana even codified the practice in our area, giving it permanence. Along the way, we not only shipped forward-thinking product changes—we built trust. Strong product partnerships are built by setting expectations, understanding motivators, and creating wins together. What started as a reorg challenge became one of the most successful collaborations of my time at Dropbox. Not because we were the same, but because we learned how to complement each other.

443	The STAR Method 	When interviewing or reviewing your own performance, it's good to have a framework that will pull the important parts of your experience to the surface. You want to show how you behave in certain circumstances, and what the results of those behaviors are. STAR turns experiences into clear, memorable stories of impact. The STAR method is one way to turn an experience into a story that will give the details your interviewer or manager needs. S — Situation Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example. T — Task Describe your scope and responsibility in that situation. A — Action Explain in detail what steps you took to address the situation. R — Result Share what outcomes your actions achieved. Why use STAR? The STAR method works because it keeps your story focused. Instead of drifting into vague descriptions or listing tasks, you clearly connect context → responsibility → action → outcome . For interviews, it highlights your skills and behaviors in real scenarios, showing how you solve problems and create impact. For performance reviews, it helps you reflect on what mattered most and communicate your growth in a structured, measurable way. In short: STAR keeps your stories concrete, memorable, and easy for others to follow. Example: Leading a Design Sprint Situation: Our team at Dropbox was facing declining activation metrics, and leadership asked us to generate bold new ideas. Task: As design lead, I needed to guide the team toward a high-impact concept within two weeks. Action: I set up a modified Google Ventures Design Sprint, aligned PM and engineering partners, and facilitated sessions to define problems, sketch solutions, and test prototypes with real users. Result: We uncovered that clarity during onboarding was the biggest driver of drop-off. The team produced a validated prototype that, once shipped, improved activation by 12%.

467	Shaping Strategy Through Targeted Activation  	At the start of 2021, it became clear that our activation strategy at Dropbox was losing steam. We’d squeezed most of the value we could from generalized onboarding—file, sync, and share alone weren’t enough to keep customers engaged. Something had to change. Spotting the Opportunity In a series of working sessions with research, data science, and product partners, we pieced together a bigger picture. The data showed that while many users were getting started, too few were unlocking the deeper value of Dropbox. Our research suggested a new direction: instead of treating all customers the same, we needed to explore targeted activation —different approaches for different types of users. Making the Case As the design lead responsible for activation within the Teams SKU, I took on the task of drafting a strategic shift. I’d been thinking about targeted activation for some time, and with the help of a passionate PM partner, we pulled together the supporting data and past research to make the case. We kicked off strategy discussions with EPD group leads, starting from the top. I proposed a two-track approach: continue generalized activation while dedicating focus to exploring targeted activation. To make that real, I suggested reorganizing our teams around distinct missions. Not everyone agreed at first. My product partner Frances pushed back on going “all in” too quickly, and rightly so. We landed on a phased rollout: start with one dedicated team, validate the opportunity, and scale from there. Together, we prepared an executive summary of the proposal, which Frances presented to senior leadership. From Idea to Strategy The first targeted activation team was formed that quarter. Within a few months, its success justified adding a second team. By the end of the year, four teams were working on targeted activation experiments. What started as a side bet became the foundation for how Dropbox approached activation moving forward. The lesson: strategy isn’t just about spotting what’s next—it’s about framing the opportunity, building alignment, and pacing the rollout so momentum grows. What I Took Away This experience reinforced how design leaders can shape strategy: by connecting insights across functions, making the case with evidence, and helping teams take manageable steps toward a bigger change. Strategy isn’t a one-time declaration; it’s a process of building conviction across the organization.

468	Designing for AI Interactions: Input, Output, and Reward	When designing for AI, there are three essential parts of the interaction we need to consider: the input, the output, and the reward. The input is the information a user sends to the machine. The output is the machine’s response back to the user. The reward is what the user does in response to the output—essentially, a second input that either reinforces or challenges the system. These interactions can be overt or hidden. Overt inputs and rewards are intentional: typing into a chat box, clicking “thumbs up,” or asking for a regenerated response. Hidden ones are unintentional: behavioral data like how long a user lingers, where they drop off, or what they ignore. Both feed the system and shape future outputs. Why the Use Case Matters The use case ultimately determines how we design the inputs, outputs, and rewards. For example, take ChatGPT’s chat. The real purpose of the product isn’t just to answer questions—it’s to learn how people interact with conversational AI and train the model. Input: a user types into an open text box with little guidance. Output: the AI responds with text. Reward: the user can copy the output, rate it up or down, ask for a regeneration, reply with a new prompt, or simply leave. The design is beautifully simple, but perfectly suited for the use case: learning from interaction at scale. Exploring Just the Input Let’s imagine a hypothetical case: “find the best restaurant near me.” There are endless ways we could design the input alone: A plain text box where the user types: “find the best restaurant near zip code 10001.” A text box with built-in suggestions to guide phrasing, paired with a hidden input that auto-detects location. A palette builder where users select favorite cuisines, plus a hidden location input that’s bundled into the prompt. Even an upload flow where users share photos of past meals they loved, combined with location detection. Each of these designs changes the interaction—and changes what the AI learns in return. The Bigger Opportunity None of this is new in principle, but what’s new is the power of today’s language models. The possibilities for interaction design are richer than ever, and our responsibility as designers is to create experiences that are transparent, valuable, and joyful. So whether you’re designing inputs, shaping outputs, or defining rewards, remember: you’re not just shaping an interface—you’re shaping how people and machines learn from one another. Have fun designing. 😃	Blog Post		0.9	post_24	2025-09-12 05:01:26.816907	2025-09-12 05:08:26.308559	2025-09-12 05:13:03.859521	\N	\N	0.50	0.10	0.00	2025-09-12 05:13:03.859521

6	Design Sprint Map for Heroes	==The [design sprint] is a tool to identify the biggest potential risk in your product and to design a solution around it.== As a fan of the Google Ventures sprint model, I wanted to share a somewhat detailed summary of one of the first steps: the sprint map.\r\n\r\n## The Sprint Map\r\n\r\nThe sprint map should be done on the first day. ==This map will be your guiding light throughout the sprint process. It will help keep you on topic and your idea focused on the part of your product where you can make the biggest difference.== As an added benefit, the construction of the map will get the entire team thinking together and committed to the process.\r\n\r\n### What you need:\r\n\r\n* 1 hour\r\n* A sprint facilitator\r\n* The dedicated attention of the sprint team\r\n* Whiteboard\r\n* Whiteboard markers\r\n\r\n### How to draw the map:\r\n\r\nThe facilitator is responsible for collecting the teams thoughts on the whiteboard.  They should try their best to avoid interpreting the team's thoughts, but if and when they do, they should be sure to ask the team "does this look right?". ==It is important that the facilitator makes sure that the team's thoughts are captured, and the result is not just the interpretation or ideas of the facilitator.==\r\n\r\nAs the facilitator stands at the whiteboard, they should help the team through\r\nthe steps of creating the map:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Left to right\r\n\r\nOn the far left side of the whiteboard, list the characters that will be most prominent in this story. ==I try to think of the map as the quest of a hero. There is the hero with a goal, and all of the integral characters they meet along the way.== Sometimes the story can break into side stories of the supporting characters, but in the end it revolves around our hero.\r\n\r\nJot down the characters on the left starting with the hero. Write who they will meet along their journey in stack formation (in order top to bottom) to complete their goal. Typically there are 2-4 characters.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-characters%402x.png)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Far right\r\n\r\nThe far right is the goal of our hero. ==The end goal is the something that our hero is trying to attain. It is usually something tangible or service oriented.== For instance: the hero wants a meal, a bicycle route, a recommendation for the best seats at the opera. The more concise this is, the easier the map will be to create (and to be honest, the entire product).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-goal%402x.png)\r\n\r\n#### 3. Map the journey\r\n\r\nThe final step is to map all of the happenings between the hero and the goal. When the hero meets a key character along the way we can write this key step as the action of the key character or the overarching result of their interaction. This journey should involve all of the key characters and their role in the journey.  If a key character doesn't participate in this path then they should be removed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-complete%402x.png)\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\n* Keep the map simple. Try to limit the journey to no more than 20 happenings.\r\n* Try to limit the amount of characters to 4\r\n* Get the group involved. Make sure the entire team is participating. As each step is drawn, ask the room "does this look right?"\r\n* Don't be afraid to erase. This process is flexible. Keep erasing or writing new ideas until it feels right.\r\n\r\n[design sprint]:http://www.gv.com/sprint/\r\n	t	2016-08-07 12:33:00	2016-08-08 01:34:53.803755	2023-07-14 18:04:45.111303	Design Sprint Map for Heroes	design-sprint-map-for-heroes		\N	==The [design sprint] is a tool to identify the biggest potential risk in your product and to design a solution around it.== As a fan of the Google Ventures sprint model, I wanted to share a somewhat detailed summary of one of the first steps: the sprint map.

13	Running a Lean Experiment	If you are building an app with limited time and money, experiments are a necessity. ==It is invaluable to learn what works, and what doesn't, before you invest time and money into an idea.==\r\n\r\nIt's true that some people get it correct the first time. But, that is  rare and risky to assume that you got it correct too. Running experiments helps you gain confidence that you are creating a _correct_ solution.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I will outline the components of a Lean experiment. ==I use Lean experiments because they emphasize spending the least amount of time to build a testable solution.==\r\n\r\n## Setting Up a Lean Experiment\r\n\r\nA Lean experiment follows a straightforward path: \r\n\r\n* Establish your riskiest assumption\r\n* Identify the customer behavior associated with that assumption\r\n* Commit to a single metric you believe in\r\n* Design a solution\r\n* Capture your hypothesis\r\n* Build the minimum viable feature/product\r\n* Document the results\r\n* Record your observations\r\n* Add your insights\r\n\r\nLet's go more into detail about each part of a Lean experiment.\r\n\r\n### [Identify the Riskiest Assumption](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-assumption)\r\n\r\nThe riskiest assumption is an assumption you are making about a key-stone element of your product. You accept it as true without evidence. ==It can take form as a belief about your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about market size, and many other things.==  It is best to start with the riskiest assumptions first.  If we don't address this assumption, this business idea might fail. \r\n\r\nThe riskiest assumption is not easy to find [1]. When trying to find your riskiest assumption, start with universal risks. Be sure to use your intuition and challenge your own assumptions. Follow up by talking with domain experts.\r\n\r\n### [The Customer's Action](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-action)\r\n\r\nHow does your riskiest assumption relate to your customer’s actions? \r\n\r\nLet’s pretend that your riskiest assumption is "customers will trust your service with their personal information". The related **action** is the customer giving you their personal information. \r\n\r\nWhen creating a Lean experiment, you want to identify an action that you can test and measure. Some examples:\r\n\r\n* Choses option a over b\r\n* Pays you for the product\r\n* Signs up for a newsletter\r\n* Comes back to the application the next day\r\n* Refers a friend\r\n\r\nThe best types of actions are real “currency” exchanges. This is when a person give you something of value to them. It demonstrates a high level of honesty in their action. ==The more currency that the person has to spend to complete this action, the more value we can associate with that action.==\r\n\r\n### Target Metric\r\n\r\nCommit to a minimum success threshold. Choose a number high enough to get you and your team excited if true and relative to the assumption you are testing.\r\n\r\n### Experiment\r\n\r\nBuild the absolute minimum required to test your assumption, as fast as possible. Don’t just confirm, learn. Include ways to capture surprises as well as real behavior important to validating your business activity is successful in influencing customer behavior.\r\n\r\n### [Hypothesis](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-hypothesis)\r\n\r\nA specific description of the customer behavior you’re measuring, your target metric and the experiment you’re running to test your assumption. If we do X, then Y% of customers will behave in way Z.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened? Record the actual metrics generated during your experiment, paying close attention to new behaviors and surprises. For example, 50% (5/10) people behaved in way Z.\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n\r\nWhy did the customer behave this way? Record the observable behavior, live feedback and reactions you witnessed firsthand, which influenced the actual results.\r\n\r\n### Insights\r\n\r\nInsights change the way you think about your customers or your idea. Record the new information you generated during this experiment, as well as unique observations made in the field.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nWas your riskiest assumption true? Look for a trend in your evidence over time. No single experiment holds all the answers. Iterate? Persevere? Pivot? \r\n\r\nIf you are running many experiments it can be a good idea to create a visual map of those experiments so your team can be aware of the progress you are making [2].\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nRemember, there is no perfect solution, but there are certainly ones that are better than others. Don't assume that you got it right. Assume that you don't know, but the people using your application will tell and show you what "right" feels like. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Endnotes\r\n\r\n- [1] https://leanstack.com/on-identifying-riskiest-assumptions/\r\n- [2] http://www.movestheneedle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rapid_Experiment_Map.pdf	t	2017-04-02 13:53:00	2017-04-02 14:09:19.448116	2023-07-14 18:02:53.805307		running-an-experiment		\N	If you are building an app with limited time and money, experiments are a necessity. ==It is invaluable to learn what works, and what doesn't, before you invest time and money into an idea.== It's true that some people get it correct the first time.

14	Kill, Pivot or Preserve	==Running out of money or time can force a product team into making difficult decisions about the future of their product. The two most challenging decisions: [pivot](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/ways-to-pivot-a-product) the product or kill it altogether.== To be presented with a challenging decision like this isn't rare; it might happen many times during the life of a product.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest stages of a product, when the risk of running out of resources is greatest, it's important to be very critical of your path and ask yourself if you should kill, pivot or persevere every couple weeks. Typically, the first time you encounter this question, you will rely on the qualitative data from customer development. As your product grows, and you have more users, you can rely on both qualitative and quantitative data such as [pirate metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version).\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to always preserve, but it isn't always the best decision. ==A product is most successful when it can be looked at critically, and changes are made based on what has been learned.== Taking the time to think about the successes and failures of your product and your limited resources, will keep you thinking about your customer and priority.\r\n\r\n## When to Kill\r\n\r\nThe hardest decisions to make about your product is to kill it. I would love to say that a product should be killed when the team has tried everything without success, but that isn't the case. Resources will run out before you can try everything. ==If you can save your resources for a project that has more promise, you probably should.==\r\n\r\nA few questions you can ask yourself before you decide to kill the project:\r\n\r\n* Do you have a continued passion for your product or vision?\r\n* Can you identify exactly why your product is failing?\r\n* Will more than 50% of your customers be "very disappointed" if you kill your product?\r\n* Are there seeing signs of success in the future?\r\n* Are there obvious pivot options that you haven't tried?\r\n* Do you have enough runway (time, money, resources) to try a pivot?\r\n* Will you be devastated if you kill your product?\r\n\r\nIf you answered **no** to more than one of those questions, this product may be ready for the shelf. But obviously, even if you did answer all of those questions with a no, you might be able to justify continuing on. Don't let a stinkin' blog post sink your ship ;) \r\n\r\n## When to Pivot\r\n\r\nThere are many types of pivots that you can make if your product isn't succeeding. Assuming that you are not feeling enough success to continue on the same path, here are some questions you can ask yourself before deciding to pivot:\r\n\r\n* Are there particular parts of your product that are being used far more than others?\r\n* Are customers complaining that your product is too specific?\r\n* Is there a particular customer segment that has responded better than others?\r\n* Are there new channels to your customers that you haven't tried?\r\n* Have you tried changing the pricing? The way you are selling your product? I.e. subscription, a la carte, etc?\r\n* Have you tried focusing on different growth model? Paid, viral, referral etc?\r\n\r\n## When to Preserve \r\n\r\nIt is easy to choose to preserve, but it isn't always the right answer. Before you decide that you don't need to make any major changes to your products path, try asking yourself a few questions:\r\n\r\n* Do you still have a passion for the vision of the product?\r\n* Is the product currently meeting your goals?\r\n* Is the product sustainable at this pace?\r\n* If the product continues at this pace, will it exceed your goals?\r\n* Do you have to defend the product to anyone on your team? \r\n* Do you feel like you have put too much into the product to give up?[IKEA effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect)\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Decision Meeting\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of a product, I like to run a kill, pivot or preserve meeting every 2 weeks. This is when the product is at the greatest risk of running out of money, time or resources. The meeting generally involves the presenter, the stakeholders and anyone that can help to answer questions about the data in the presentation. ==The presenter, often the founder, presents a quick summary of the last 2 weeks, then makes a recommendation to the stakeholders to kill, pivot or preserve. The stakeholders often ask questions, and then vote for or against the recommendation.== Often, you get a consensus, but if that isn't possible, you follow the majority vote or the stakeholder with the largest stake.\r\n\r\n### The Agenda\r\n\r\n* Review the vision of the product.\r\n* Review the goals for the last 2 weeks.\r\n* Talk about what was achieved, and what was learned.\r\n* Present the decision about what to do next, and how the learnings have informed this decision and what steps you will take.\r\n* Vote on it.\r\n\r\n### The Presentation\r\n\r\nI usually create the presentation the day before or day of the meeting. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes to create. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be clear and consistent. It is a great tool to look back and see what you have tried and what you have learned.\r\n\r\nThe presentations can be difficult to compile. When I sit down to start creating the presentation, I often think to myself "what did we do the last 2 weeks?" ==As I begin to prepare the presentation I am almost always wowed by what we have learned and accomplished.== My presentations are anywhere from 5 - 10 pages, and take about 10 minutes to present.  A decision meeting presentation might include:\r\n\r\n* Reminder of the vision of our product.\r\n* Brief summary of what was accomplished in the last 2 weeks.\r\n* Overview of the [meaningful metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version) if you are far enough along.\r\n* Successes and failures, and what we learned from them.\r\n* List of assumptions that have been tested, and if they were validated or invalidated.\r\n* Brief summary of the budget, burn and runway.\r\n* The decision to kill, pivot or preserve.\r\n* A rough plan for the next 2 weeks\r\n\r\nA decision meeting can provide a lot of value. You are setting a tone of transparency. Sharing exciting findings and demonstrating progress. Uncovering new learnings and explaining the direction of the product. Celebrating successes, and illuminating failures as an opportunity to learn. ==Finally, you are keeping the team and stakeholders in the loop and vested and interested in the product.==	t	2017-04-10 14:11:00	2017-04-02 14:11:17.603321	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	Kill, Pivot or Preserve	kill-pivot-or-preserve		\N	==Running out of money or time can force a product team into making difficult decisions about the future of their product.

16	Validation with Facebook Ads 	Before you start building the world’s most awesome app, it’s a good idea to find out if people want it. I know it’s hard to believe others might not love your idea, but unfortunately, not everybody likes the same stuff. If we find out others have interest, you can avoid wasting time and money building something nobody wants.\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ads experiment will give you a high-level understanding around the following:\r\n\r\n- if you have a strong unique value proposition\r\n- if people desire to learn more about your idea, and\r\n- which audience cares the most about it\r\n\r\n<mark>This experiment will not give you proof - this experiment will give you confidence.</mark> Wouldn't it be nice to have confidence that someone other than your best friend likes your idea?\r\n\r\n# The Experiment\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ads experiment leverages Facebook’s large and diverse user base and its rich data about those users. With this data, you can target specific audiences and uncover the level of interest in your idea.\r\n\r\nEach experiment will involve running 2 ads to A/B test against. Each ad has a design that highlights the unique value proposition and targets a specific audience. <mark>In each experiment, you isolate a variable to uncover which one garners interest. Those variables could be the unique value proposition, design, or audience.</mark>\r\n\r\n## Getting set up\r\n\r\nIn order to run this experiment you will need a few things:\r\n\r\n- An idea for an app.\r\n- At least one Unique Value Proposition (UVP) - it’s okay to have more than one.\r\n- A well-defined audience that will be using your app.\r\n- A Facebook account\r\n- _Optional but highly recommended: Facebook page *_\r\n- _Optional but highly recommended: Splash page **_\r\n\r\n<small>\r\n* If you want your ad to appear in the Facebooks users’ news feeds, you will need a Facebook page and a website. A simple Facebook page with an image and a single post saying coming soon will cover the page. A simple splash site stating your UVP and a "coming soon" will work.\r\n</small>\r\n\r\n<small>**If you do create the splash page, you could incorporate a currency exchange. This would allow people to pay or sign up to be on a waiting list. Here is an example of a somewhat in-depth splash page to test a currency exchange http://www.nillyapp.com/ </small>\r\n\r\n## Running the ads\r\n\r\nTo run the ads, visit https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads. You will need to log into your Facebook account to create the ads. I won’t go into great detail about how to do actually create the ads since the UI changes so often, but I will cover the main points. \r\n\r\n### Ad Type\r\n\r\nIdeally, you want an ad that is meant to generate leads. You could create an ad that drives people to a Facebook page, but you wouldn’t benefit from the possible currency exchange of a splash page. Regardless of what type of ad you pick, make sure that you are charged per click. Clicks are a low-level form of validation.\r\n\r\n### Audience & Placements\r\n\r\nChose an audience that is narrow. A large vague audience makes it more difficult to determine who is interested in your idea. You have the option to run ads just on Facebook, on Instagram, or on their entire ad network. If you believe that one of those areas doesn’t apply to you, then feel free to cut it out. Just make sure that you are consistent with all the ads.\r\n\r\n### Budget & Schedule\r\n\r\nEach ad should run for at least 7 days. I tend to spend about $100 to start. It's really up to you.\r\n\r\n### Design & Content\r\n\r\nDesign and content encompass the format, media, page, and links. You will want to create a simple ad that shows your UVP and has a call to action. Here is an example ad:\r\n\r\n![Example Facebook Ad](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad%402x.png)\r\n\r\n## Taking action with each test\r\n\r\nFor the best results, you'll want to run at least 3 A/B tests. If the first 3 A/B tests return mixed results, you may want to run up to 6 A/B tests. I'll do my best to guide you from where to start and then based off of your results, where to go next. \r\n\r\n## Determining success\r\n\r\nBare in mind that these A/B test will return a single data point for you to compare results - clicks per impressions. You have to determine what success looks like. Different ideas should have different thresholds.\r\nIf your idea is hard to execute and you need many users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be very high. If your idea is easy to execute and needs a few users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be low.\r\n\r\nTry to answer these questions to determine a success threshold:\r\n\r\n- How difficult do you think it will be to execute on your idea?\r\n- How many users do you think you will need to be successful?\r\n- How much competition is there for your idea?\r\n- What is the average lifetime value of a customer?\r\n- What is the average cost for this kind of product?\r\n- What is the size of your audience?\r\n\r\n## Things to avoid\r\n\r\nAvoid the desire to get clicks! Keep in mind that just getting clicks isn’t going to teach you anything - you need to know why you got the clicks. This is not about advertising best practices. You can throw words like “free” and “limited time” that will encourage clicks, but we don’t want that. <mark>We want an ad that tests only the value of your idea and the audiences that see it.</mark>\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable outcomes is to identify that your idea doesn’t resonate with anybody.  You save all the time and money it takes to build something nobody needs.\r\n\r\n# Experiments\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with style variable\r\n\r\nThis test will help you identify if your unique value proposition garners interest from a particular audience. You can run a single ad by itself, but I prefer to run 2 ads with the same content but different styles. This helps create a variable and a control to use for comparison. \r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n![value proposition with style variable example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad-comparison%402x.png)\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- same audience (control)\r\n- same unique value proposition (control)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- different aesthetic style (variable)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\n<mark>If both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that enough people like your idea, then you've got some validation.</mark> You can stop experimenting if you'd like, or if you want to be more thorough, you can move on to the second test: testing the audience.\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks per impressions than the other, you could be concerned that the unique value proposition isn’t strong enough and that the ads visual style is what garnered the clicks. You should run a UVP A/B test to isolate the style as the enticing factor.\r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks to make you happy, you should run this test again with a different UVP.\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with value proposition variable\r\n\r\nThis test is to help us identify the interest of our unique value proposition. Unlike the solo UPV a/b test, here we are going to pit two UVPs against each other. This test is great to run when you have competing ideas, or when you are not sure which aspect of your idea people are most interested in.\r\n\r\nWhen creating this ad, make sure that the ad is simple and focuses mostly on the unique value proposition.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n![Value proposition with value proposition variable example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad-uvp-comparison%402x.png)\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- same audience (control)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- same aesthetic style (control)\r\n- different unique value propositions (variable)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it.\r\n\r\nIf both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you might want to do two things: one - run a solo UPV test with each UVP to see if the style was the draw, or two - pick the UVP that is coupled with the least risky to execute business plan. \r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try three things: pick two completely different UVPs and run this again, try a different UVP and run the solo UVP tests, run this test again with a different audience.\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with audience variable\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this experiment is to determine which audience responds best to the UVP. This experiment is best if you think your UVP is great, but the audiences you have tested thus far, are the wrong audiences. \r\n\r\nThis test should be run only after you have run either the value proposition with style variable or the value proposition with value proposition variable experiment. </mark> You will use the same value proposition and style for both ads, but now you’ll run them on two different audiences. \r\n\r\nIt might seem that you could run only one ad this time, and compare results to the previous experiment, but we would then be creating an experiment with two variables: audience and dates the ad ran. <mark>It is important to note that dates can affect click through rates - holidays, times of the year, days of the week, can all affect click rate. </mark> It is best to have only one variable, so you should run two ads for the most accurate results.\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- different audiences, one should be the same as a previous experiment (variable)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- same aesthetic style from the previous experiment (control)\r\n- same unique value propositions from the previous experiment (control)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it.\r\n\r\nIf both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you should be good to go. You know that more than one audience resonates with your value proposition.\r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try two things: pick a completely different UVP and run this again or pick a different UVP and run the UVP test.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ad experiment is a great place to start to build confidence that your idea is resonating with a larger group of people. It is by no means perfect, but it is a good tool for de-risking your product idea up front. Remember, the biggest resource you have is your own time. Be sure to take steps up front to understand if your product can be successful. \r\n\r\n\r\n	t	2017-07-10 10:36:00	2017-09-11 16:47:04.477352	2023-07-14 18:02:28.613096	Validation with Facebook Ads	validation-with-facebook-ads		\N	Before you start building the world’s most awesome app, it’s a good idea to find out if people want it.

17	Validation with Google Keywords	One of the quickest methods to gain confidence in your product is the [Google Aords Keyword Planner Tool](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/) <mark>You can leverage it to get real data that shows how often people are searching the problem you hope to solve.</mark> \r\n\r\n## Example: \r\n\r\nYou want to deliver emoji-cupcakes because you felt that there was a lack of bakeries that offered them. After some research, you've learned that this is true in your region. You've talked to 10 people who also feel the same way, and would love an emoji-cupcake delivery service. During your conversations with them, you also uncovered a new problem. Of those who ordered emoji-cupcakes in the past, the ordering process is complex and the variety limiting. \r\n\r\nYou're feeling pretty good about this, and you want some more validation. This is where the Google Adwords Keyword Planner tool comes in. Let's run an experiment.\r\n\r\n## Setting up the experiment\r\n\r\nWith this experiment, we use the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool to identify:\r\n\r\n* How many people are searching for "emoji-cupcake delivery"\r\n* What countries/regions/states/cities is that search is most common\r\n* Is there competition for this business idea\r\n\r\nTo get started, define the keywords that you think are important to this search. Some suggestions: *emoji-cupcake, emoji-cookie, emoji-cupcake delivery, cupcake delivery*. Once you have those, check out how they fair using the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool.\r\n\r\n## Analyzing the results\r\n\r\nAfter you run the query, you will get results that contain your keywords and related search phrases. You can use this to draw some high-level conclusions.\r\n\r\n### Search Volume\r\n\r\nSearch volume will give you an idea of the level of interest for each search phrase. If nobody is using your search phrases or similar search phrases, then there probably isn't much demand for the idea. \r\n\r\nLike most of these early-stage experiments, you have to determine the success threshold. Do 10k searches per month make you feel like there is a market for what you are selling? 100k? 1 million? \r\n\r\n### Suggested Bid\r\n\r\nWe can hypothesize that if a suggested bid is high, then a person is willing to pay for that solution/product. The idea is that advertisers are willing to pay for these ads at this high price, so they must be worth to warrant the expense.\r\n\r\nCombine this with the search volume for more insight. A high volume and high suggested bid could mean that there is a lot of people searching for a solution, and a lot of people willing to pay for it.\r\n\r\n### Specificity\r\n\r\nThe number of words in the search phrase can also be insightful. Let's say you tested "chores". You will probably see a lot of search volume, but we don’t really know what the user was looking for. The user could have been looking for a list, perhaps a snack called "chores". We can't be too sure. However, if we make the search phrase more specific like “how to share chores with roommates”, we have a much better idea of what problem the user is trying to solve.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources\r\n\r\n<small>* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qtT9o--kQ</small>	t	2017-07-25 14:15:00	2017-09-11 20:56:26.128778	2023-07-14 18:02:19.688595	Validate Your Business Idea With Google Keywords 	validation-with-google-keywords		\N	One of the quickest methods to gain confidence in your product is the Google Aords Keyword Planner Tool <mark>You can leverage it to get real data that shows how often people are searching the problem you hope to solve.</mark> Example: You want to deliver emoji-cupcakes because you felt that there was a lack of bakeries that offered them.

26	Blind App Review	I was recently given the prompt in an interview to "evaluate, provide feedback on creative work, and communicate improvements on design". It's a robust prompt — and it came in the form a a blind app review focused on the creative conception of a product. I love it. A big part of being a designer is being able to give critical feedback and recognize areas for improvement. \r\n\r\nI wanted to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. My goal was to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can help create a better product.  \r\n\r\nHere is the approach I took:\r\n\r\n# My Approach\r\n\r\n1. [Say Hi](#say-hi)\r\n1. [Intro The Process](#intro-the-process)\r\n1. [Familiarize](#familiarize)\r\n1. [Evaluate UI/UX](#evaluate-ui-ux)\r\n1. [Analyze Brand Expression](#analyze-brand-expression)\r\n1. [Assess Aesthetics And Taste](#assess-aethetics-and-taste)\r\n1. [Identify The Good And Bad](#identify-the-good-and-bad)\r\n1. [Propose Changes](#propose-changes)\r\n<div class="u-padding-bottom-x-large"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="say-hi"></a>\r\n## 1. Say Hi \r\n\r\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the pressure, and challenge, of an interview - let alone a blind app review. Start off slow, say hi, and show your warmth first.  Don’t forget that you're working with another person. Demonstrating your expertise is great, and showing how you include others and leverage the skills around you is a multiplier. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="intro-the-process"></a>\r\n## 2. Intro The Process\r\n\r\nIntroduce the interviewer(s) to your process. Show them you have one, and let them follow along.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="familiarize"></a>\r\n## 3. Familiarize\r\n\r\nSpend some time exploring and interacting with the app. This will help you understand its functionalities, user interface (UI), and user experience (UX).\r\n\r\n- What is your first impression?\r\n- What are the positive aspects?\r\n- What immediately jumps out that can be improved?\r\n- What you think the main jobs-to-be-done or problems solved are?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="evaluate-ui-ux"></a>\r\n## 4.

21	Ways To Pivot A Product	If you've hit a point in your product when progress or growth has halted and the current path forward is no longer working, perhaps it's time for a pivot. As Eric Reis put it "a pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision."\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of pivots. Some, such as a marketing pivot or channel pivot, don't involve changing your product. Others can be as drastic as stripping away all the things that aren't working, and zooming-in on only the most important feature. Here is a short list of some different pivots to get your brain flowing:\r\n\r\n><mark>A pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision.</mark>\r\n\r\n><small>Eric Reis</small>\r\n\r\n# Customer need pivot\r\n\r\nIn some cases, early on your customers might show little interest in the problem you are solving. This pivot is about rethinking the value of the problem you are solving. Perhaps it's time to solve a different problem with a completely new product. \r\n\r\nOne of the most popular customer need pivots is Groupon. You've probably never heard of the website "The Point": a social good fundraising site that employed the _tipping point system_ to secure funding. When enough people promised a pledge, the funding would be secured - kind of like Kickstarter. It didn't catch on. The founder decided to pivot to a different customer need using the same concept of the _tipping point_. The Point became Groupon. A site where groups of people could hit a tipping point that would open up coupons for use. \r\n\r\n# Zoom-in pivot\r\n\r\nDo you have at least one great feature? Take only the most successful feature (most used? highest grossing?) and strip away anything that isn't necessary for the success of that feature. Double-down on what has been working well, rather than trying to expand into new areas.\r\n\r\nNokia began as a paper mill in 1865. As the company grew, they expanded what they produced, including rubber goods, electronics, and telecommunications devices. In 1992, they zoomed-in and decided to focus exclusively on their mobile devices. They sold off all other divisions of their company and rose to great success (albeit unmaintainable...) \r\n\r\n# Zoom-out pivot\r\n\r\nIf you have an extremely focused product and simple feature set, perhaps it's time to think about expanding into new areas and solving other problems. Dig into your customer and see if they are using your product as a compliment to other software or tools. If so, think about solving for some of the problems that those other tools solve.\r\n\r\nA great example of the zoom-out pivot is PayPal. PayPal started specifically to allow people to beam payments over handheld PDAs. It took a lot of permutations, and the merger with a financial services company, before PayPal became a payments platform. Quickly thereafter, they became the preferred online payment system for eBay and rose to glory.\r\n\r\n# Customer segment pivot\r\n\r\nPerhaps your product solves an actual problem, but the customers who you've been targeting don't appreciate it the way you'd hoped they would. Was there another audience that hinted at the value of your product, but it wasn't for them? Perhaps now is a good time to try and position and optimize your product for a more appreciative segment.\r\n\r\n# Business model pivot\r\n\r\nYour product may not be the problem. Perhaps your pricing model and monetization strategy are inhibiting your product from being more successful. A business model pivot is about altering your pricing model, monetization strategy, and marketing strategy to capture the most value. \r\n\r\nHave fun pivoting ;)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonnazar/2013/10/08/14-famous-business-pivots/#4631e34e5797\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC_IG-EZQUY\r\n- http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\r\n- http://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4\r\n- https://www.fastcompany.com/3001984/pinterest-pivot	t	2017-08-02 21:45:00	2017-09-19 18:45:37.227208	2023-07-12 18:50:22.978948	Ways To Pivot A Product	ways-to-pivot-a-product		\N	If you've hit a point in your product when progress or growth has halted and the current path forward is no longer working, perhaps it's time for a pivot.

27	Manager or Individual Contributor 	Are you questioning which track to take as a Product Designer - Manager or Individual Contributor (IC)? Are you managing someone who is questioning which track to take? Throughout my career, I've had to make this decision personally, as well as work with colleagues that were making this decision. I've tried to support mentees, reports, and colleagues, and let me tell you, the context surrounding the decision is never the same twice. \r\n\r\nIn an [ADP List](https://adplist.org) mentee session, I was asked for some support with the following situation:\r\n\r\n> [...] I've been working as both a product designer and a design manager. However, the scope of the product I'm working on is too big, and I can't work effectively with my team. As a result, I've had to cancel my 1:1 meetings with my direct reports and can't help them when they need my assistance. This situation is frustrating for me.\r\nI recently discussed this with my manager, and they asked me what my choice would be if the company gave me the opportunity to continue working as a design manager/lead or as an individual contributor/product designer.\r\n\r\nMy goal with in that meeting, and with this post is to provide, two significant pieces of information that might help with thinking through this topic. \r\n\r\n# Do Consider\r\n#### Are you comfortable making decisions that directly affect people's lives?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe role of a manager varies, but one thing is clear: your decisions directly impact people's lives. You decide which projects they'll work on, their salary, and even their employment status.\r\n\r\nOf course being a manager has its joys: helping people develop new skills, setting them up for success, and creating opportunities are just part of the fun. However, being a manager also means making tough decisions and giving feedback.\r\n\r\nA good manager is emotionally available, able to handle difficult situations, resolve conflicts, and address issues face-to-face. If you're uncomfortable telling someone they're not performing well, reassigning them from a beloved project, or in the extreme letting them go, then being a manager may not be for you.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't want to focus solely on the challenges, it's important to recognize that you can't be a good manager if you're not willing to make decisions that directly affect people's lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Do Not Consider\r\n#### Do you love using your technical skills?\r\n\r\nMany people claim that as a manager, you no longer need to use your technical design skills. However, it's not about using the same skills, but rather leveraging your expertise and applying your technical abilities to new areas of responsibility. Don't think of switching tracks as a waste of your acquired skills. If someone tells you that you're wasting your skills, they're only looking at the outcomes you've delivered, not considering your true potential.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if you feel that you lack the technical skills to progress in your current track, take a moment to reflect. Are you experiencing imposter syndrome, lacking motivation, or simply not ready to invest in your career? It's alright if you're not prepared to develop new skills in your current path. \r\n\r\nHowever, if that's the case, now may not be the right time to explore a new track. First, ensure that you understand what is inhibiting your desire to invest in yourself. Simply changing tracks isn't always reliable inspiration. In fact, it can often backfire and further hinder progress, as immediate wins may become even more scarce.\r\n\r\n# Closing\r\nwhether you're deciding between a Manager or Individual Contributor (IC) track or supporting someone in this decision, consider the unique context of each situation.

72	Raising the Bar Without Slowing Down 	## The Challenge  \nIn January 2023, our design organization went through a reorg. I was leading design across 4 groups with 12 squads, supported by two managers and two senior architects. 30% of the people had joined Dropbox in the last 6 months.\n\nWhen I stepped back to evaluate the work, I saw issues: experiences below our quality bar, duplicative bespoke patterns, and overly designed solutions. With so many new folks learning unfamiliar surfaces, I knew the problem would only compound. My task was clear: raise the quality of solutions—without slowing the team down.  \n\n## The Approach  \nWe already had processes documented, and our managers were empowered to lead. So I made a conscious choice: instead of micromanaging execution, I would focus specifically on solution quality.  \n\nI aligned with the managers and senior ICs to define a “quality standard” for the team. The philosophy was simple: if leadership is calibrated, we can scale feedback consistently across all squads.  \n\nTo reinforce the standard, we added rituals: critiques followed by leadership calibrations, a living document to capture overlapping experiences and conflicts, and plans of action that made design intent transparent and ROI-driven. We also introduced velocity tracking to ensure that our focus on quality didn’t come at the cost of speed.  \n\n## What Changed  \nThe results came quickly. Teams began to identify quality issues themselves, cutting down on bespoke one-offs and increasing cohesion across experiences. Designers leaned into usability testing, negative feedback dropped, and velocity actually increased.  \n\nPattern cohesion improved, connectivity across experiences strengthened, and the overall quality bar rose noticeably. Most importantly, it wasn’t me alone setting the bar—it was the managers and senior ICs pushing for specific changes and scaling that expectation across their squads.  \n\n> “By aligning leadership on quality, we empowered the whole team to raise the bar—without sacrificing speed.”  \n\n## Key Lessons  \n1.

33	Leadership Lessons from Product Design	Every day working as a leader brings new challenges that make me question whether I'm doing it right. But I've learned a few things along the way—usually the hard way—that might be helpful to share.\n\n\n## Coaching Scales\n\n> Coaching creates more leaders, while dictating only creates followers. \n\nEarly in my time at thoughtbot, I was given the chance to work with the Mayo Clinic. They were a powerful, detail-oriented, impactful organization. But they lacked the tech muscles—things like design thinking, agility, lean principles—that we now take for granted.  \n\nAs a leader, my instinct was to prove my value by demonstrating expertise. I brought in processes like the Google Ventures Design Sprint and introduced ways to validate ideas quickly. But it didn’t take long to realize I had no place being a domain expert in that room. The Mayo team had decades of medical expertise; I had deep knowledge of tech. What I didn’t have was the authority to be both.\n\nAt the same time, I noticed my design partner wasn’t contributing. When I asked why, they admitted it was because they felt overshadowed—I was trying to play both the medical and tech expert, leaving them unsure of their role.  \n\nThat was my turning point. I had to stop leading by example and start leading by coaching.  \n\nI shifted my approach: instead of positioning myself as the voice of tech, I asked my design partner to co-facilitate the sprint. Each evening we’d run a short retrospective using a simple framework:  \n\n- **What’s the goal?**  \n- **What did you try that worked?**  \n- **What didn’t work?**  \n- **What will you try differently tomorrow?**  \n\nBy giving them the space to lead and coaching them through the process, I wasn’t just solving the problem in front of us—I was building their capability to run design sprints long after this project ended.  \n\n---\n\n## Clarity Drives Execution\n\n> Empowerment without clarity isn’t leadership—it’s abdication.\n\nSetting strategy is more than understanding the product and the needs. It's setting up the team to be able to execute on the strategy by empowering through clarity. I learned this lesson while leading a project at Dropbox to rework the admin control panel. My boss had asked me to explore the area and come up with a strategy for long-term impact.  \n\nI believed I was setting this up for success. I broke the work into parts—exploration, opportunity sizing, vision development—and passed it to a senior architect I trusted to lead the charge. But here’s where I failed: I didn’t wrap the work in *clarity*.  \n\nI never gave the business context. I didn’t spell out why this mattered, how it connected to strategy, or what trade-offs might shape the outcome. Without that clarity, the architect did what any strong partner would: thorough exploration, solid research, and a robust vision. But the vision leaned toward expansion, not evolution, and missed critical questions about how the product might change or even deprecate.  \n\nThe result? The project eventually got derailed and had to be reset.  \n\nThe lesson was sharp and clear: **it’s not enough to delegate work—you have to create clarity in your asks.** Why are we doing this? How will it connect to the business? What are the boundaries? Without that framing, even great work can veer off course.  \n\nNow, whenever I set direction, I make sure the *why* is explicit. Clear context doesn’t constrain creativity—it channels it toward impact.  \n\n---\n\n## Define Innovation\n\n> Define what innovation means for your company, then build a culture around that definition.\n\nInnovation is one of those words that gets thrown around a lot, but rarely defined. For a long time, I thought it meant creating flashy, groundbreaking solutions. Over time, I’ve learned that innovation isn’t just about solutions—it’s about how you define the problems worth solving, and the culture you build around addressing them.  \n\nToo often, when leaders ask for “innovation,” what they really want is something else: incremental improvements, a competitive edge, or even a whole new category. Without a shared definition, teams default to chasing shiny solutions instead of understanding the purpose behind the call for innovation.  \n\nThe most successful innovation I’ve seen has come when we start by clarifying what we mean. Is this about finding new problems? About defending our position in the market? About reshaping our category? Once that’s clear, you can create the conditions—a culture of exploration, constant scanning of trends and competitors, and space for people to push boundaries.  \n\n---\n\n## Hire for Evolution and Purpose\n\n> Teams that last are built by hiring for evolving roles, embracing culture add, and anchoring everything in mission. \n\nIf you want to build a team that lasts, you can’t just hire for today’s gaps—you hire for the role as it will evolve. Strong teams aren’t built around temporary needs; they’re built around people who can grow with the work and with each other. \n\nOne major factor of building the right team is seniority; it plays a huge role in how you think about focus, impact, and potential for attrition.\n\n**Junior hires** tend to desire to be generalists and built a breadth of skills. They grow into the work, take on optimizations, and support smaller projects. Their impact scales over time as they gain confidence and breadth. Their focus areas should be obvious, and there should be space for skill development.\n\n**Senior and staff-level hires** are different. You’re not hiring them primarily to grow; you’re hiring them to *own*. Their role is to take on a large, complex scope that the company knows will stay true over time. As Reid Hoffman described it, senior hires often operate on a “tour of duty”—they’re brought in to tackle a mission-critical challenge for a period of years, and to leave behind stronger foundations than they found.  \n\nAnother major factor is understanding the cultural needs of those you might hire. I don’t believe in “culture fit.” What lasts isn’t sameness—it’s evolution. When building a team, I ask internally "What about our culture do we want to preserve?" and "What do we want to embrace as people bring themselves into it?". And when building the team, I ask "How do you contribute to evolving a team's culture?"\n\nThat’s **culture add**. A team that lasts is one where the culture adapts, grows, and evolves with the people who join it.  \n\nLastly, I try to hire for purpose. The most important ingredient for longevity is purpose. If you want longevity, people need to care deeply about the mission. Impact and culture alone won’t sustain a team — purpose will. When people believe in the mission, they push each other, they evolve the culture, and they build resilience through challenges.  \n\n---\n\n## Transparency builds resilience\n\n> In storms, people don’t need a flawless leader—they need an honest one.  \n\nLeadership isn’t always smooth sailing. There are pivots, reorganizations, and the natural turbulence of building products. In those moments, I’ve learned that the job isn’t to have all the answers—it’s to create clarity where you can, and to be honest about what you don’t know.  \n\nWhen our company went through a major reorganization, I felt as uncertain as anyone about what the future would hold. Instead of pretending otherwise, I focused on what I *could* provide: helping the team understand what was changing, what wasn’t, and how we’d keep our commitment to great design intact.  \n\nIn difficult moments, transparency is complex. It isn’t just about sharing everything you know; it’s about communicating in a way that provides clarity, maintains psychological safety, and respects the people affected. Timing matters. When people’s jobs or roles are on the line, transparency must come with care and urgency—you owe it to your team to treat them fairly and never leave them in limbo.  \n\nThe takeaway for me has been this: in times of uncertainty, transparency is generally your ally. That means preempting questions, listening for murmurs of concern, and directly addressing the fear that sits beneath so many of them: *is my job at risk?* You can’t always remove the uncertainty, but you can remove the silence.  \n\nIt wasn’t perfect, but by leaning on clarity, honesty, and timing, the team adapted. We came out stronger and more resilient—not because I had all the answers, but because we faced the uncertainty together.  \n\n---\n\n## Ambition Has Seasons\n\n> Your leadership journey maps to your ambition. Understanding its timing is what makes it sustainable.\n\nLeadership is often described as a journey, not a destination—and that’s true. But what I’ve learned is that the shape of that journey is defined by ambition.  \n\nAt different moments, ambition can expand or contract. Sometimes you want to push hard, take risks, and grow into the next stage. Other times, life outside of work is complex, stability matters more, or you need space to sustain yourself. In those moments, chasing constant ambition can lead to burnout, distraction, or lost impact.  \n\nAs a leader, I’ve had to recognize this in myself—and in my team. Not every season of someone’s career has to be about acceleration. Part of building sustainable leadership is identifying ambition correctly, embracing it at the right time, and respecting when it needs to pause.  \n\n---\n\n## Lessons Learned  \n\nAcross all of these experiences, a few principles stand out:  \n\n- **Coaching scales** – Coaching creates more leaders, while dictating only creates followers.  \n- **Clarity drives execution** – Delegation without context isn’t empowerment; it’s drift.  \n- **Define innovation** – Innovation isn’t novelty, it’s cultural. Start by defining what it means in your company.  \n- **Hire for evolution and purpose** – Teams last when you hire for roles that grow, value culture add, and anchor in mission.  \n- **Transparency builds resilience** – In uncertainty, timing and honesty matter more than polish.  \n- **Ambition has seasons** – Not every moment requires acceleration. Sustainable leadership respects when ambition expands and when it contracts.  \n\n---\n\n## Resources  \n\nA few books and frameworks that shaped these lessons:  \n\n- *Good Strategy, Bad Strategy* — Richard Rumelt | Clear thinking on setting direction.  \n- *Radical Candor* — Kim Scott | Frameworks for feedback and care.  \n- *The Coaching Habit* — Michael Bungay Stanier | Asking better questions, not giving better answers.  \n- *Turn the Ship Around!* — L.

Along the way, I’ve learned that listening, coaching, context, pragmatism, and trust are the levers that make a team thrive. 	leadership-lessons-from-product-design		Leadership is something I’m still figuring out. Every day, I run into challenges that make me question whether I’m doing it right. But along the way, I’ve learned some lessons—usually the hard way—that might be useful to share.\n\nThe first is about coaching. Early in my leadership journey, I thought being the leader meant being the smartest person in the room, swooping in with answers. But the real shift came when I realized that coaching scales. When you coach, you create more leaders. When you dictate, you only create followers.\n\nThe second lesson is about clarity. Delegation by itself isn’t enough. If you don’t wrap the work in context—why it matters, how it connects to strategy, and what the boundaries are—you’re not empowering, you’re abdicating. The best work I’ve seen comes when people know the “why” and have the space to figure out the “how.”\n\nThen there’s innovation. It’s one of those words leaders throw around, but rarely define. And without definition, teams often chase shiny solutions that don’t add value. Real innovation is cultural—it’s about creating space to uncover problems worth solving and being clear on what innovation means in your company, whether that’s incremental improvement or a bold shift.\n\nBuilding teams is another area where I’ve stumbled and learned. Teams that last don’t happen by accident. They’re built by hiring for evolving roles, looking for culture add instead of culture fit, and anchoring everything in mission. Purpose is what sustains a team over the long run.\n\nAnd when storms hit—and they always do—the lesson for me has been about transparency. It’s not just about sharing everything; it’s about timing, clarity, and respect. People don’t need a flawless leader when things get tough. They need an honest one.\n\nFinally, I’ve realized that leadership maps to ambition. There are seasons when you push hard and take big risks, and seasons when stability matters more. Sustainable leadership is about recognizing that in yourself and your team, and knowing when to accelerate and when to pause.\n\nSo those are the lessons I carry with me: coach, create clarity, define innovation, build resilient teams, lead with transparency, and match ambition to the season. I don’t always get them right. But they’re the tools that help me, and my team, do our best work.	Every day working as a leader brings new challenges that make me question whether I'm doing it right. But I've learned a few things along the way—usually the hard way—that might be helpful to share. Coaching Scales Coaching creates more leaders, while dictating only creates followers. Early in my time at thoughtbot, I was given the chance to work with the Mayo Clinic. They were a powerful, detail-oriented, impactful organization. But they lacked the tech muscles—things like design thinking, agility, lean principles—that we now take for granted. As a leader, my instinct was to prove my value by demonstrating expertise. I brought in processes like the Google Ventures Design Sprint and introduced ways to validate ideas quickly. But it didn’t take long to realize I had no place being a domain expert in that room. The Mayo team had decades of medical expertise; I had deep knowledge of tech. What I didn’t have was the authority to be both. At the same time, I noticed my design partner wasn’t contributing. When I asked why, they admitted it was because they felt overshadowed—I was trying to play both the medical and tech expert, leaving them unsure of their role. That was my turning point. I had to stop leading by example and start leading by coaching. I shifted my approach: instead of positioning myself as the voice of tech, I asked my design partner to co-facilitate the sprint. Each evening we’d run a short retrospective using a simple framework: What’s the goal? What did you try that worked? What didn’t work? What will you try differently tomorrow? By giving them the space to lead and coaching them through the process, I wasn’t just solving the problem in front of us—I was building their capability to run design sprints long after this project ended. Clarity Drives Execution Empowerment without clarity isn’t leadership—it’s abdication. Setting strategy is more than understanding the product and the needs. It's setting up the team to be able to execute on the strategy by empowering through clarity. I learned this lesson while leading a project at Dropbox to rework the admin control panel. My boss had asked me to explore the area and come up with a strategy for long-term impact. I believed I was setting this up for success. I broke the work into parts—exploration, opportunity sizing, vision development—and passed it to a senior architect I trusted to lead the charge. But here’s where I failed: I didn’t wrap the work in clarity . I never gave the business context. I didn’t spell out why this mattered, how it connected to strategy, or what trade-offs might shape the outcome. Without that clarity, the architect did what any strong partner would: thorough exploration, solid research, and a robust vision. But the vision leaned toward expansion, not evolution, and missed critical questions about how the product might change or even deprecate. The result? The project eventually got derailed and had to be reset. The lesson was sharp and clear: it’s not enough to delegate work—you have to create clarity in your asks. Why are we doing this? How will it connect to the business? What are the boundaries? Without that framing, even great work can veer off course. Now, whenever I set direction, I make sure the why is explicit. Clear context doesn’t constrain creativity—it channels it toward impact. Define Innovation Define what innovation means for your company, then build a culture around that definition. Innovation is one of those words that gets thrown around a lot, but rarely defined. For a long time, I thought it meant creating flashy, groundbreaking solutions. Over time, I’ve learned that innovation isn’t just about solutions—it’s about how you define the problems worth solving, and the culture you build around addressing them. Too often, when leaders ask for “innovation,” what they really want is something else: incremental improvements, a competitive edge, or even a whole new category. Without a shared definition, teams default to chasing shiny solutions instead of understanding the purpose behind the call for innovation. The most successful innovation I’ve seen has come when we start by clarifying what we mean. Is this about finding new problems? About defending our position in the market? About reshaping our category? Once that’s clear, you can create the conditions—a culture of exploration, constant scanning of trends and competitors, and space for people to push boundaries. Hire for Evolution and Purpose Teams that last are built by hiring for evolving roles, embracing culture add, and anchoring everything in mission. If you want to build a team that lasts, you can’t just hire for today’s gaps—you hire for the role as it will evolve. Strong teams aren’t built around temporary needs; they’re built around people who can grow with the work and with each other. One major factor of building the right team is seniority; it plays a huge role in how you think about focus, impact, and potential for attrition. Junior hires tend to desire to be generalists and built a breadth of skills. They grow into the work, take on optimizations, and support smaller projects. Their impact scales over time as they gain confidence and breadth. Their focus areas should be obvious, and there should be space for skill development. Senior and staff-level hires are different. You’re not hiring them primarily to grow; you’re hiring them to own . Their role is to take on a large, complex scope that the company knows will stay true over time. As Reid Hoffman described it, senior hires often operate on a “tour of duty”—they’re brought in to tackle a mission-critical challenge for a period of years, and to leave behind stronger foundations than they found. Another major factor is understanding the cultural needs of those you might hire. I don’t believe in “culture fit.” What lasts isn’t sameness—it’s evolution. When building a team, I ask internally "What about our culture do we want to preserve?" and "What do we want to embrace as people bring themselves into it?".

68	Turning Flat Solutions Into Impactful Ones  	## When Good Work Falls Flat  \nIn Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I was a Design Director overseeing teams working in new areas—freelancer tooling, admin actions—and a few of our solutions weren’t sticking. Some shipped features looked promising at first, but they didn’t make much impact. The riskiest bet was a time-tracking feature. It was polished, but it wasn’t solving anything people really cared about.  \n\n## My Role as Design Director  \nThis was my responsibility. Not to redesign the feature myself, but to help my team figure out why our work wasn’t landing—and to help them build the skills to avoid this trap in the future.  \n\n## The Real Problem  \nWhen I dug in, I realized what was happening. The team was moving fast, which usually I encourage, but in this case speed had a cost. Designers were focusing on user experience details and execution, but skipping the hard part: validating value. We weren’t asking, *is this the right problem?* or *does this solution actually matter?* Effort was being measured in design hours, not in ROI.  \n\n## Resetting with a Framework  \nI knew we needed a reset. I brought the designers together and shared a framework I rely on: diagnosis, principles, actions. We diagnosed the issue—too much energy on polish, not enough on value. We agreed on principles to guide us: scope to impact, show your work so feedback comes early, and break things down instead of going all in on big bets. Then we turned those into actions: identify risk up front, align on design time needed, document the process and share it with partners, and test value on medium- and large-sized projects before going too deep.  \n\n## How the Team Responded  \nThe team ran with it. One designer introduced lightweight “plans of action” that made our design process transparent and invited PMs in earlier. Another led concept testing sessions, bringing early user feedback into critiques before ideas hardened. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, concept tests were informing direction, and PMs were leaning in with curiosity instead of just waiting for handoffs.  \n\n## What Changed  \nThe shift was dramatic. Riskier projects started getting tested for value before anyone sunk months of work. Vague ideas like “time tracking” sharpened into clear problems like “help me get paid,” and then into focused solutions like “create me an invoice.” Designers weren’t just executing—they were shaping strategy. PMs began engaging more deeply in the design process, and the team itself started adding new process ideas beyond the ones I’d suggested.  \n\nOur solutions got smaller, sharper, and less risky. More importantly, the team gained new habits—plans of action and concept testing—that raised the quality of design work across the board.  \n\n> “When you slow down just enough to validate value, you actually speed up the path to solutions that matter.”  	t	2022-04-02 00:00:00	2025-09-02 14:11:05.293614	2025-09-05 13:01:06.981764	A story about how I helped my team at Dropbox validate value early, turning flat solutions into impactful ones.  	turning-flat-solutions-into-impactful-ones			When Good Work Falls Flat In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I was a Design Director overseeing teams working in new areas—freelancer tooling, admin actions—and a few of our solutions weren’t sticking.

73	Breaking Out of Incrementalism	## The Challenge  \nWhen I first joined Dropbox, I inherited a small team of three ICs working on Onboarding. They were in the middle of a transition—from acting as a service arm to PM partners toward becoming embedded in squads. The problem was that they weren’t able to get ahead of the work.  \n\nInstead of shaping strategy, they were shipping small optimizations: moving a button here, tweaking a flow there, A/B testing everything. The work was revenue-generating, but the quality and impact of solutions were starting to degrade. Watching this pattern, I realized we were heading in the wrong direction.  \n\n## My Role  \nAs Design Director, it was my responsibility to make sure the solutions were not only good but impactful. I also needed to motivate the team by giving them meaningful problems to solve—not just incremental tasks handed down from PMs.  \n\n## Resetting the Strategy  \nI started by analyzing the reality of the situation: why were we stuck in small optimizations? My conclusion was that the team lacked a clear process to shape bigger opportunities.  \n\nSo I drafted a strategy framework:  \n1. **Draft** → Identify opportunities and outline hypotheses.  \n2. **Align** → Partner with PMs and stakeholders to ensure we were chasing the right goals.  \n3. **Iterate and Refine** → Explore multiple design directions, not just one.  \n4. **Validate** → Run concept testing with users to confirm value early.  \n5. **Execute** → Deliver solutions with confidence that they mattered.  \n\nI socialized this approach with PM partners, showing them how a more strategic design process could still serve business needs while unlocking bigger opportunities.  \n\n## The Results  \nThe shift was significant. By validating ideas earlier and aligning on impact, we moved away from low-leverage optimizations toward more meaningful improvements in onboarding.  \n\nDesigners felt more motivated because they were working on problems that mattered. PMs became more engaged partners, excited to test concepts and understand user value rather than just running button-placement experiments.  \n\nIn short, we traded “moving buttons” for solving real onboarding challenges—and design’s impact grew noticeably.  \n\n> “Small optimizations keep you busy. Validating value makes you impactful.”  \n\n## Key Lessons  \n1. Incremental work is a signal—it shows when process is broken.  \n2.

The work generated revenue but the impact was fading. I introduced a simple strategy: draft opportunities, align with PMs, iterate broadly, validate with users, and then execute. That shift helped us break out of incrementalism. Designers worked on problems that mattered, PMs engaged more strategically, and onboarding improvements became bigger, sharper, and more impactful. The lesson? Small optimizations keep you busy, but validating value makes you impactful. 	The Challenge When I first joined Dropbox, I inherited a small team of three ICs working on Onboarding.

Our products\r\nallows tenants to see the energy usage of each apartment. The lowest energy\r\nconsumer gets bragging rights. Let's look at two assumptions and score them:\r\n\r\n**Tenants are willing to share their energy usage with their neighbors.

30	Turning Constraints Into Better Outcomes	## The Challenge  \nIn Q3 of 2022, my team at Dropbox faced a daunting project: a new license type called “Flexible Licensing.” The initial estimate was that it would take 12–18 months to complete. Leadership wanted proof it was worth investing that kind of time and energy, but the team saw massive technical risk and leaned toward saying “no.” My job as Design Director was to break that deadlock and find a way to move forward without overcommitting.  \n\n## Resetting Expectations  \nThe turning point came in a meeting with area and group leads where an Engineering Manager and a Product Design Manager argued that the scope was simply too large. I immediately challenged the “no” response. With support from partners, I reframed the problem: don’t block it—scope the risk instead. That shift forced the team to articulate the specific risks and explore possible solutions rather than shutting the project down.  \n\n## Speed as a Strategic Constraint  \nInstead of aiming for perfection, I challenged the team to show what they could validate in just six weeks. Speed became a constraint, not a liability. With that framing, the team identified ways to mitigate risk: launching with a small beta group rather than every platform, using design and communication to set expectations clearly, and focusing only on the most critical functionality.  \n\nAn Engineering Manager stepped up with a scrappy but well-thought-out plan, proving that the concept could move forward with limited investment.  \n\n## What We Delivered  \nThe team shipped an alpha version of Flexible Licensing to a small set of willing adopters. Designers broke the problem into manageable parts, engineers mapped out dependencies we could avoid, and together we delivered something valuable without waiting years. Some platform-specific benefits had to wait, but by narrowing scope, the timeline shrank dramatically.  \n\nThe alpha not only validated the concept but also gave us room to focus on quality where it mattered most. The result was a smaller, sharper, more useful solution that scaled because customers immediately found value in it.  \n\n> “Constraints don’t just speed you up—they can actually make the work better.”  \n\n## Key Lessons  \n1. Challenge assumptions instead of accepting “no.”  \n2. Use constraints strategically—speed can sharpen focus.  \n3. Break complex problems into parts that can be validated.  \n4. Validate value before investing heavily.  \n5. Leverage beta groups to learn fast.  \n6. Quality often emerges from working within limits.  	t	2024-01-15 00:00:00	2025-09-01 02:59:11.489504	2025-09-04 04:35:04.482743	How I used speed as a constraint to turn a year-long licensing project at Dropbox into a scrappy alpha that proved value fast. 	turning-constraints-into-better-outcomes		In 2022 at Dropbox, my team faced a huge project: a new license type that was scoped at more than a year of work. Engineers saw too much risk and wanted to say no. Instead, I reframed the problem—don’t block it, scope the risk. We set speed as a constraint and asked what we could validate in six weeks. The team launched a scrappy alpha to a beta group, proving value without massive investment. The lesson? When you use constraints strategically, you don’t just move faster—you often end up with better quality too.  	The Challenge In Q3 of 2022, my team at Dropbox faced a daunting project: a new license type called “Flexible Licensing.” The initial estimate was that it would take 12–18 months to complete. Leadership wanted proof it was worth investing that kind of time and energy, but the team saw massive technical risk and leaned toward saying “no.” My job as Design Director was to break that deadlock and find a way to move forward without overcommitting. Resetting Expectations The turning point came in a meeting with area and group leads where an Engineering Manager and a Product Design Manager argued that the scope was simply too large. I immediately challenged the “no” response. With support from partners, I reframed the problem: don’t block it—scope the risk instead. That shift forced the team to articulate the specific risks and explore possible solutions rather than shutting the project down. Speed as a Strategic Constraint Instead of aiming for perfection, I challenged the team to show what they could validate in just six weeks. Speed became a constraint, not a liability. With that framing, the team identified ways to mitigate risk: launching with a small beta group rather than every platform, using design and communication to set expectations clearly, and focusing only on the most critical functionality. An Engineering Manager stepped up with a scrappy but well-thought-out plan, proving that the concept could move forward with limited investment. What We Delivered The team shipped an alpha version of Flexible Licensing to a small set of willing adopters. Designers broke the problem into manageable parts, engineers mapped out dependencies we could avoid, and together we delivered something valuable without waiting years. Some platform-specific benefits had to wait, but by narrowing scope, the timeline shrank dramatically. The alpha not only validated the concept but also gave us room to focus on quality where it mattered most. The result was a smaller, sharper, more useful solution that scaled because customers immediately found value in it. > “Constraints don’t just speed you up—they can actually make the work better.” Key Lessons Challenge assumptions instead of accepting “no.” Use constraints strategically—speed can sharpen focus. Break complex problems into parts that can be validated. Validate value before investing heavily. Leverage beta groups to learn fast. Quality often emerges from working within limits.	\N

It is a level of engagement so concentrated, you don't realize that time has passed until you are out of your flow state.

Once I have established a general layout, I like to use the browser for tweaking styles and component placement. \r\n\r\nI have no hard-and-fast rule about when to make the transition from a design tool to the browser, other than when I feel like I am making a lot of minor adjustments to my design file. At that point, it usually means that I am generally happy with the design and it's time to get a little more nitty gritty and try things out. This is also great when you aren't starting a design from scratch, rather iteration to optimize, or perhaps adding a new feature. \r\n\r\nThe most cumbersome thing about designing in the browser is the tools that are available to work with. You either write the CSS locally and refresh the browser, or fidget with the browser tools to see what you like then copy that over to your CSS. \r\n\r\nHowever, with [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) you can write CSS as you normally would; in your text editor. When you save the file, the browser reflects the changes you made without you having to refresh the page. \r\n\r\n## Installing the gem\r\n\r\nWe only want Guard to be operating in our development environment.

18	The Value Based Product Designer	This week on Draft\r\n\r\nLast week’s Revise Weekly lesson was about repeat sales from past customers. This week’s is about a related aspect: referrals from past customers to existing ones.\r\nThis fortnight’s Draft Analysis will be about shaving darlings Harry’s. I am a secret shaving snob, so this will be fun.\r\nThe Problem With Images\r\nIn a recent letter, I chatted about the ideal format for a case study, using Draft’s most recent one as an example. A few noted that I had a screenshot there – but given its size & crop ratio, along with the lack of a link back to the page in question, it wasn’t really helpful as a visual.\r\n\r\nThat is by design. If you’re a designer who focuses primarily on business value, then you should not have visuals in your portfolio, no matter how visually-oriented of a designer you may be.\r\n\r\nI know this is easy to say as a designer who focuses on text, layout, and behavior. Yet with visual portfolios, it is even more essential to omit visuals from any public expression of your work.\r\n\r\nThe constraint: economic buyers can’t read the meaning of images\r\n\r\nWhen we start out as designers, we’re so conversant in visual language that we’re utterly shocked when clients and stakeholders can’t understand our underlying thinking.\r\n\r\nYet over time, we come to understand that they’re coming to the engagement with their own motives, and we need to express our thinking in advance of sharing new work. Most of one’s growth as a designer comes in the form of strategic communication skills: pitching new work, justifying various decisions, and crafting a game plan of potential tradeoffs that may occur during a critique session.\r\n\r\nAs a result, when a value-based designer is about to engage in critique, they spend considerable time and energy setting up their thinking before sharing images. That keeps the conversation focused on the right goals, and allows us to justify strategic direction without regressing to a discussion of personal preferences or arbitrary, self-constructed goals.\r\n\r\nThink about a situation in your career where mockups were shared prematurely, or without annotation. It’s nearly certain that the client misinterpreted the work, leading to way more backpedaling and damage control than would be appropriate in any engagement. This isn’t good or bad; it’s a natural consequence of all humans being visual thinkers, and we need to view it as a necessary constraint of our profession, no matter if we’re purely visual (illustrators, etc), functional (interaction design, strategy), or somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nThe consequences\r\n\r\nThe tendency of economic buyers – no, humans – to downplay a designer’s thinking in favor of visuals has three key consequences. Any one of these should be enough to justify never using visuals in your portfolio again.\r\n\r\nConsequence 1: Visual portfolios don’t build consensus\r\n\r\nThe goal of a portfolio is to convey your thinking and focus. Good portfolios get a prospective client to come around to your point of view. As a result, they provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate your focus on the economic value that design can provide for their business.\r\n\r\nThe constraint here is that you are communicating, mostly, to strangers. You lack the luxury of an existing client relationship, and you’re probably passively selling your work to a growing audience on your website. What about a visual in and of itself is capable of this, in the face of the headwinds your design practice already faces?\r\n\r\nConsequence 2: Visual portfolios distract from your thinking\r\n\r\nVisuals are useful for conveying your overall style, which is unfortunately of no business importance to the reader.\r\n\r\nValue-based designers know work begets work. This is great for building up a reputation over time, especially within a specific positioning – but it also means that if prospective clients see any visuals, they will hire you in order to stamp out a clone of a past project – not to provide business value.\r\n\r\nConsequence 3: Visuals fundamentally can’t bolster a business argument\r\n\r\nYou are there to convey two things to the reader:\r\n\r\nDesign has business value. It’s 2017 and nobody knows this. I know. It’s dumb. You still have to undo all the damage that designer-artists have done – and continue to do – to the integrity of our profession over the past 30 years.\r\nYou use design as a tool to create business results. This should be self-explanatory. It proves you’re a safe bet. It shows you will provide a more reliable return on the company’s investment.\r\nIf someone sees a visual, they’re going to focus on the visual. And if they focus on the visual, they’re not going to fully understand the challenge, thinking, operational issues, and ultimately value-based upside that you’re capable of providing to a client.\r\n\r\nPretty’s cheap; strategy has real value\r\n\r\nEvery time you add a visual, you are downplaying the importance of any other text you’ve written. And there is nothing more important than the text. Nothing.\r\n\r\nThat’s why designers should use at least 1,000 words of explanation, justification, and business strategy per mockup shared to the client.

A more advanced experiment to get a far better sense of validation is the Facebook/AdWords Ad Experiment. Probably the best validation experiment you can run is the Fake Door experiment. ==Most products fail because nobody wants them.== Don't be that person - do some customer development and idea validation before you spend so much of your valuable time building something nobody is going to use.	\N
20	The IKEA Effect	As a Designer and Product Consultant, one of the most common traits I see in product teams is an unwillingness to throw away the things they've made. Some of the teams I've worked with celebrate removing lines of code, but ==more often then not, people believe that what they made is too valuable to throw away== (even if it can be brought back using Github, [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) or the myriad other forms of version control.)\r\n\r\nThe feeling of sunk costs comes in many forms: you might care what others think of you or that you'll regret quitting because you might be on to something. What I encounter most often is a team that feels their work is too valuable to toss. ==This is known as the IKEA effect: labor equals valuation.==\r\n\r\nThe IKEA effect was coined by Michael I. Norton a, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely after conducting a study on how labor affects valuation. They captured their findings in the paper [The IKEA Effect: When Labor Meets Love](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20mochon%20ariely.pdf). \r\n\r\nThe researchers set up four studies in which they had the participants assemble IKEA boxes, fold origami, and put together sets of Legos. The researchers found that participants viewed their amateur creations to have equal value to that of an expert's creation. Moreover, they expected others would feel the same. \r\n\r\n> <mark>Participants saw their amateurish creations as similar in value to experts' creations and expected others to share their opinions.</mark>\r\n\r\n> <small>Michael I.Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely</small>\r\n\r\nHowever, if the participants were asked to destroy their creation as part of the task, or failed to complete the assembly, the feeling of value was gone. The conclusion was that labor leads to love when labor results in successful completion of tasks, and that labor increases valuation for both “do-it-yourselfers” and novices.\r\n\r\nIf you're ever on the fence about tossing a feature or throwing out some code, ask yourself if you see value in it because you built it.

23	Better Meetings	Meeting fatigue is a common issue in this Virtual First world we work in. There are loads of reasons that video meetings feel taxing. What stood out to me is the actual effect that back-to-back video meetings has on your brain. Some recent research done by [Zoom and Microsoft brought to light that back-to- back video meetings has a negative effect on the brain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2021/04/20/our-brains-need-breaks-from-virtual-meetings/?sh=4b7d38fd21e9).

22	What Makes a Real MVP?	Working as a consultant, I’m always pushing for an MVP. Why? Because they’re cheaper to build, and more importantly, most people don’t actually know what to build—and they shouldn’t. Not until real users are using it, and you can clearly see and hear the value your product delivers.  \n\nSo, let’s chat about an MVP—a minimum viable product.  \n\nAn MVP should be three things:  \n\n1. The least amount of features needed to get the job done.  \n2. A journey that people can complete without so much frustration they give up.  \n3. Something that adds real value.  \n\n## The IKEA Bed Analogy  \n\nLet’s say you need a bed. If I ship you an IKEA MALM bed frame with no instructions, could you build it and have a comfy place to sleep? Sure—but with a lot of anguish. That version checks boxes one and three: it’s minimal, and it provides value in the end. But it fails box two. If people give up because the journey is too hard, it’s not an MVP—it’s just an MP.  \n\nNow, add some instructions. Suddenly, the same bed is achievable. The journey isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough. And that’s what makes it viable.  \n\n## How to Test if It’s an MVP  \n\nOne simple way: run a usability test. Give a user a goal and watch what happens. If they get stuck saying, *“I don’t know what to do now”*—and they can’t figure it out within a reasonable effort—you’ve got a problem.  \n\nMVPs don’t need to be perfect, but they need to be **good enough**: clear, smooth, and usable, so that people can actually achieve their immediate goals and see the value.  \n\n## The Real Lesson  \n\nNext time you’re building an MVP, don’t focus on how awesome it is. Focus on how clear it is. Because clarity is what makes something viable.  	t	2017-12-07 00:00:00	2017-12-07 02:45:30.978681	2025-09-12 05:03:01.77262	A real MVP isn’t just minimal—it’s viable, meaning usable, clear, and valuable enough that people won’t give up before they reach the outcome.	what-makes-a-real-mvp		When I talk about MVPs, I don’t just mean “the smallest version of your product.” An MVP has to be minimal, yes—but it also has to be viable. That means a user can achieve their goal without so much frustration that they quit. Think of IKEA furniture. If I ship you a MALM bed with no instructions, technically it works. You’ll have a bed in the end—but only after hours of pain. That’s not viable. Add the instructions, and suddenly it’s achievable. That’s a real MVP. The simplest way to test this? Run a usability test. If people can’t figure out what to do next with reasonable effort, you don’t have an MVP. You’ve just got an MP. So next time you’re building one, don’t ask yourself how awesome it is—ask yourself how clear it is.	Working as a consultant, I’m always pushing for an MVP. Why?

32	Intersession Engagement Strategy	## The Challenge\n\nAt Grow Therapy, we identified intersession engagement as a critical strategic priority. The therapy experience couldn't just happen once a week in a one-hour session. To deliver better care, support providers, and demonstrate outcomes strong enough to maintain insurance contracts, we had to improve the quality of care that happened between sessions.\n\n## The Solution\n\n### Session Topics Feature\n\nWe designed a system that prompted clients to reflect on their therapy experience before sessions. Key features included:\n\n- **Guided Reflection**: Help clients who struggle with reflection\n- **AI Summarization**: Convert open reflections into actionable topics\n- **Dynamic Prompting**: Contextual timing based on client journey\n- **Provider Preparation**: Clear, concise summaries for therapists\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\nThe solution focused on helping people who don't know how to reflect, rather than just serving those who already had the habit. This required:\n\n- Expanding the problem space beyond simple note-taking\n- Using exploration frameworks to generate divergent ideas\n- Studying competitors and using AI tools for inspiration\n- Validating why reflection was difficult in the first place\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n### Innovation vs. Pragmatism\n\nWe championed audio-first reflection based on evidence from our Summit acquisition, but adapted when the CTO pushed back. This showed the importance of balancing innovation with organizational alignment.\n\n### Strategic Pivots\n\nThe feature moved between standalone and mobile app integration multiple times. Success required maintaining vision while adjusting execution strategy.\n\n### Impact Measurement\n\nThe initiative demonstrated that intersession engagement was not only possible but powerful, advancing care quality and supporting measurable outcomes.	t	2025-09-01 00:00:00	2025-09-01 02:59:11.683693	2025-09-02 04:01:15.231816		intersession-engagement-strategy		\N	The Challenge At Grow Therapy, we identified intersession engagement as a critical strategic priority.

34	Creating Design Principles That Get Used	Design principles are everywhere. Most design orgs have them, but too often they sit in a Notion doc or slide deck, rarely shaping real decisions. The challenge isn’t just writing principles—it’s creating ones that teams believe in, use, and hold each other accountable to.  \n\n## Why Have Design Principles?\n- Create alignment → Give teams a shared lens for making decisions, reducing subjective debates.\n- Connect design to company ethos → Anchor design choices in the broader mission, not just aesthetics.\n- Raise quality consistently → Define what “good” looks like so the bar isn’t left to interpretation.\n- Accelerate decision-making → Provide a shortcut when trade-offs or conflicts arise.\n- Scale design thinking cross-functionally → Make design values accessible to PMs, engineers, and others, not just designers.\n\n## Start with Listening, Not Writing  \nThe first step isn’t drafting. It’s listening. Before any words go on the page, I’ve found it essential to run a listening tour—surveying designers, PMs, engineers, and researchers about what feels inconsistent in the work. Ask questions like:  \n- Do we feel aligned in how we make design decisions?\n- Do our design choices reflect the company’s values and ethos?\n- Do we have a shared understanding of what “quality” means in our work?\n- Do disagreements in critique or product reviews often feel subjective?\n- Do cross-functional partners understand how design makes decisions?  \n\nPatterns emerge quickly, and they highlight the gaps principles can fill.  \n\n## Involve the Right Stakeholders Early  \nDesign principles aren’t just for designers. If they only live in critique sessions or design documentation, they won’t influence the broader product. That’s why it’s critical to involve cross-functional partners early—PMs, engineering leads, brand design, even executives. Without their buy-in, principles risk becoming “design wallpaper.”  \n\nAt Grow Therapy, we drafted a thoughtful set of principles:  \n\n1. **Prioritize the therapeutic relationship**  \n2. **Support, don’t overshadow**  \n3. **Celebrate growth, big and small**  \n4. **Be inclusive and compassionate by design**  \n\nEach principle came with clear “when done right” and “when done wrong” examples, plus product tie-ins from rescheduling, reviews, and treatment plans. They were grounded in the actual problems we were solving.  \n\nBut here’s the hard truth: they were never adopted.  \n\nWhy? Because I didn’t bring the right stakeholders in early enough. Brand Design wanted to lead, but they were waiting on company-wide principles. Our VP of Product wasn’t engaged early, so alignment never solidified. We ended up in a waiting game, and the staff designer I asked to drive the effort didn’t have clear channels to get feedback and input from those who mattered most.  \n\nThe principles were strong. The process was weak.  \n\n## Choose the Right Owner  \nEvery principle needs a champion, but not a dictator. The right owner is someone who can communicate clearly, bring people along in the process, and keep the focus on collaboration over ego.

At Grow Therapy, we drafted a strong set of principles around supporting therapeutic relationships, celebrating growth, and being inclusive by design. But here’s the catch—they were never adopted. I hadn’t brought in key stakeholders early enough, like Brand and our VP of Product, and the staff designer leading the effort didn’t have clear channels for feedback. The result? A waiting game where nothing moved forward. The lesson for me was clear: principles only work when the process includes cross-functional buy-in, the right owner to drive them, and examples that make them real. Otherwise, they don’t make it past the slide deck.	Design principles are everywhere. Most design orgs have them, but too often they sit in a Notion doc or slide deck, rarely shaping real decisions. The challenge isn’t just writing principles—it’s creating ones that teams believe in, use, and hold each other accountable to. Why Have Design Principles? Create alignment → Give teams a shared lens for making decisions, reducing subjective debates. Connect design to company ethos → Anchor design choices in the broader mission, not just aesthetics. Raise quality consistently → Define what “good” looks like so the bar isn’t left to interpretation. Accelerate decision-making → Provide a shortcut when trade-offs or conflicts arise. Scale design thinking cross-functionally → Make design values accessible to PMs, engineers, and others, not just designers. Start with Listening, Not Writing The first step isn’t drafting. It’s listening. Before any words go on the page, I’ve found it essential to run a listening tour—surveying designers, PMs, engineers, and researchers about what feels inconsistent in the work. Ask questions like: Do we feel aligned in how we make design decisions? Do our design choices reflect the company’s values and ethos? Do we have a shared understanding of what “quality” means in our work? Do disagreements in critique or product reviews often feel subjective? Do cross-functional partners understand how design makes decisions? Patterns emerge quickly, and they highlight the gaps principles can fill. Involve the Right Stakeholders Early Design principles aren’t just for designers. If they only live in critique sessions or design documentation, they won’t influence the broader product. That’s why it’s critical to involve cross-functional partners early—PMs, engineering leads, brand design, even executives. Without their buy-in, principles risk becoming “design wallpaper.” At Grow Therapy, we drafted a thoughtful set of principles: Prioritize the therapeutic relationship Support, don’t overshadow Celebrate growth, big and small Be inclusive and compassionate by design Each principle came with clear “when done right” and “when done wrong” examples, plus product tie-ins from rescheduling, reviews, and treatment plans. They were grounded in the actual problems we were solving. But here’s the hard truth: they were never adopted. Why? Because I didn’t bring the right stakeholders in early enough. Brand Design wanted to lead, but they were waiting on company-wide principles. Our VP of Product wasn’t engaged early, so alignment never solidified. We ended up in a waiting game, and the staff designer I asked to drive the effort didn’t have clear channels to get feedback and input from those who mattered most. The principles were strong. The process was weak. Choose the Right Owner Every principle needs a champion, but not a dictator. The right owner is someone who can communicate clearly, bring people along in the process, and keep the focus on collaboration over ego. Low ego, high drive, and strong facilitation skills are the traits to look for. Ownership here is about stewardship—ensuring principles evolve with the team and get used in the day-to-day. If I could go back, I’d have paired the staff designer with a more senior sponsor—someone who had visibility and credibility across leadership—to make sure the right doors got opened. > “The process of making design principles is as important as the principles themselves—it’s how you build trust in them.” Build Through Collaboration Principles can’t be handed down from on high.

70	Navigating Conflicting Directives\n	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I found myself in the middle of a tension that’s common in large organizations: conflicting directives from leadership. My group was focused on collaboration within teams, spanning across the Pro SKU, Business Standard, and Enterprise. At the start of the quarter, my PM partner was advised to divest from Enterprise clients and lean toward short-term revenue. Meanwhile, my boss instructed me to go deeper into Enterprise and invest in a new admin experience. Both perspectives had merit, but they pointed us in opposite directions.  \n\n## Diagnosing the Conflict  \nThe misalignment surfaced in a team leads meeting. My PM partner and I compared notes and realized that what our respective leaders were asking us to prioritize didn’t line up. When we raised this misalignment, stakeholders asked us to demonstrate a feasible path forward rather than just flag the problem.  \n\nDigging deeper, we uncovered a few important dynamics. A senior architect was advocating for the admin opportunity and had the ear of my boss, partly through past backchannel conversations. At the same time, company goals were clearly oriented toward short-term revenue. The disconnect wasn’t just about strategy—it was also about communication breakdowns and a lack of clear roles.  \n\n## Actions to Move Forward  \nThe first step was to repair communication. I sat down with the senior architect and clarified roles and responsibilities: I would remain accountable for strategy, and he would be responsible for execution. That created much-needed clarity.  \n\nNext, I worked with my PM partner to reestablish priority. We were able to align stakeholders on the importance of short-term revenue, but there was no agreement on the right approach. To break the deadlock, I proposed a compromise: give the architect a three-week runway to see if the admin initiative could be broken into smaller pieces that might generate faster revenue. We allocated DS and PMM support for exploration, while also pushing forward with PMs and design leads on expanding paid security features, which had clearer near-term upside.  \n\n## Results and Lessons  \nThe architect ran lightweight concept testing with smaller enterprise clients, partnered with PMM for customer conversations, and collaborated with DS on data exploration. Despite the effort, we didn’t find a credible short-term revenue path. With evidence in hand, we communicated our recommendation to divest from Enterprise and refocus on nearer-term opportunities.  \n\n> “Sometimes leadership isn’t about choosing a side—it’s about creating a path to test both and letting the evidence guide the decision.”  \n\nThis experience reinforced a few lessons for me. First, misalignment often stems from communication gaps as much as from strategy itself. Second, defining clear roles and responsibilities helps build trust and avoids power struggles. And finally, when faced with conflicting directives, creating a structured way to test assumptions not only brings clarity, it helps stakeholders feel heard—even if their preferred path isn’t the one pursued.	t	2022-07-20 00:00:00	2025-09-04 03:52:13.286579	2025-09-04 04:48:34.980618	How I resolved conflicting directives at Dropbox by designing a test that let evidence—not politics—guide the decision.  	navigating-conflicting-directives			In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I found myself in the middle of a tension that’s common in large organizations: conflicting directives from leadership.

71	Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact	## The Challenge  \nIn Q1 of 2021, activation work at Dropbox was inconsistent. My team had developed an effective strategy for helping new users get to value, but outside of our group, the approach wasn’t being used. Other teams were working on their own versions of “new user experience,” but the results weren’t impactful or aligned with the strategy we knew worked. Without adoption beyond our group, our impact was limited.  \n\n## My Role  \nAs a Design Director, my responsibility was to improve the outcomes of design work—not just in my team, but across the company. That meant scaling our activation thinking beyond our walls and creating a foundation others could adopt.  \n\n## Building the Framework  \nThe first step was to codify what worked. I drafted an activation framework that captured the principles behind our success and began socializing it with designers outside my group. To build momentum, I also started an “Onboarding Guild,” a forum where designers could seek advice on building activation solutions.  \n\nAdoption was slow. Even though the framework was clear and rooted in the CCC model, most teams continued to do their own thing. I realized we needed more than documentation—we needed proof.  \n\n## Changing the Evangelization Strategy  \nI asked two teams to apply the framework and capture their results. These case studies became the evidence we needed. With that in hand, I shifted my strategy: instead of sending the framework to individual designers, I started sharing it directly with cross-functional leads. I showcased team wins in relevant forums and in all-function Slack channels, making the framework’s value visible to PMs, engineers, and other stakeholders.  \n\n> “Scaling a strategy across an organization isn’t about telling people what to do—it’s about showing them why it works.”  \n\n## The Impact  \nWith real examples and cross-functional buy-in, adoption spread.

The Onboarding Guild continued under new leadership, carrying the culture forward.

74	Turning Struggle Into Growth	In Q1 of 2020, while leading design at Dropbox, I faced one of the more difficult parts of people management: helping a talented designer who was underperforming.  \n\nOver several months, I had noticed that one of my designers’ work was slipping. Their solutions were consistently overcomplicated, they were slow to deliver, and the final outputs often missed the core value we needed to ship. Confidence was waning, and feedback from peers reflected the same struggles. Previous attempts to coach them back on track hadn’t stuck, and eventually they received a low review score and landed on a formal performance plan.  \n\nAs their manager, it was my responsibility to ensure Dropbox maintained a high-quality design bar. But equally, I felt responsible for their growth, morale, and clarity. The challenge was clear: I had to balance empathy for the individual with accountability to the team and company.  \n\n## Getting to the Root Cause  \n\nI began with a direct conversation, not just to deliver feedback but to invite their own perspective. My goal was to align our perceptions of what wasn’t working. When we sat down, they shared that motivation was the deeper issue.  \n\nThey didn’t feel energized by their current projects — smaller, incremental improvements — and longed instead for big, sweeping feature launches. In their mind, *impact* meant scale.  \n\nThis insight reframed the problem. The gap wasn’t only skill or output; it was motivation.  \n\n## Reframing the Work  \n\nWe talked openly about how to approach the situation differently. Instead of focusing on one large project, I encouraged them to view smaller projects as opportunities to ship quickly, build momentum, and practice restraint. Constraints, in this case, could be empowering.  \n\nI asked them to design their own improvement plan: specific skills to work on, clear milestones, and goals tied to the team’s roadmap. Together, we agreed on shorter timelines and limited exploration for each project, ensuring they stayed focused. I committed to weekly check-ins and made sure to gather peer feedback so they could see where they were improving.  \n\n## The Turnaround  \n\nOver the next three months, their approach shifted. With tighter timelines and smaller scopes, they moved faster, delivered simpler solutions, and regained confidence. Their performance improved enough to come off the performance plan. The team benefitted as well: solution quality rose, and we shipped more consistently.  \n\nBut while performance improved, their motivations didn’t change. They still felt underutilized focusing on smaller projects. After six months, they decided to leave Dropbox for a role better aligned with their passions.  \n\n## What I Learned  \n\nThis experience taught me that performance management is as much about **understanding motivation** as it is about addressing skill gaps. By reframing the work and creating constraints, I was able to help this designer improve in the short term and leave on better terms in the long run.  \n\nFor the business, it was a win: we shipped stronger work and maintained momentum during a critical period. For the designer, it was also a win: they left with clarity about what truly motivated them, and a chance to pursue work that better fit their strengths.  \n\nNot every performance story ends in long-term retention. Sometimes success looks like coaching someone through a rough patch, holding them accountable, and ultimately helping them find the right environment where they can thrive.

75	Managing Performance With Empathy	## The Challenge  \nIn early 2020, I noticed one of my designers struggling. Their solutions were overly complex and often missed the core value of the problem. Feedback from peers confirmed what I was seeing: they tended to overthink, move slowly, and deliver work that didn’t land.  \n\nThe decline in confidence showed up in reviews as well, leading to a low performance score and eventually a performance plan. As their manager, it was my responsibility not just to hold the bar on quality, but to support this person as a designer and as a teammate.  \n\n## Getting to the Root  \nWe sat down to talk openly about their performance. I presented the feedback I’d gathered, but more importantly, I asked them to share their perspective. I wanted us to align on expectations and uncover what was really going on.  \n\nWhat emerged was motivation. They weren’t excited by small, incremental improvements. What they wanted was to build big, impactful features in nascent areas—fast. But when the reality of their work didn’t match that vision, they lost energy and fell into overcomplication.  \n\n## Reframing the Work  \nTogether, we reframed the challenge. Instead of waiting for one big, perfect project, we set up a structure around smaller ones. I asked them to create a plan that addressed their challenges directly, with goals, milestones, and specific skills to improve.  \n\nThe biggest change was introducing tighter timelines and limiting exploration for smaller projects. This gave them constraints to work within and a chance to build momentum. I ensured their milestones aligned with the team’s roadmap and held weekly check-ins to track progress. We also built in feedback loops so they could hear directly how their work was landing.  \n\n## The Outcome  \nThe change was noticeable. Within three months, their speed and quality improved. They used the tighter timelines as a motivator and successfully got out of their performance plan. The team benefited as well—solution quality went up, and we shipped more.  \n\nBut while performance improved, motivation didn’t. They still felt underutilized by focusing on smaller projects. We tried to create opportunities for them to work on larger initiatives, but we couldn’t find the right fit inside Dropbox. Six months later, they left for a role that better matched their aspirations.  \n\n## What I Learned  \nThis experience reinforced two truths of management.

76	DraftMotivating High Performers Through Scope and Strategy  	## The Challenge  \nIn Q2 of 2021, I was managing a high-performing Design Manager at Dropbox—let’s call her **Maya**. She excelled across the board—design process, strategy, craft, and communication. She led a team of four ICs and was respected by her peers.  \n\nDuring a career conversation, Maya shared her desire for a promotion. Promotions can be motivating, but they’re not always in a manager’s control. My job was to ensure she felt supported, that her strengths were maximized, and that we aligned her day-to-day work with what truly motivated her.  \n\n## My Coaching Approach  \nWhen coaching high performers, I focus on three things:  \n\n1. Understand their core motivation  \n2. Give them choices that align with that motivation  \n3. Connect their work to visible progress toward it  \n\nWith Maya, it quickly became clear that her motivation was about **scope**. She wanted to scale her impact in strategy and process—those were the areas that energized her. We agreed that demonstrating those skills at scale would also improve her chances of promotion, even if the timing of that outcome wasn’t fully in our control.  \n\n## Finding the Right Opportunities  \nMaya and I set aside time for a working session to brainstorm ways she could stretch her scope. We both brought ideas, and ultimately we chose two:  \n\n- She would **own a cross-group process project** focused on feature validation and experimentation.  \n- She would **delegate craft quality responsibilities** to a senior IC, which gave that person greater influence while freeing Maya to focus on strategy.  \n\nWe checked with cross-functional partners to ensure alignment and adjusted Maya’s goals to reflect these new responsibilities. From there, we set up monthly check-ins to track her progress.  \n\n## What Happened Next  \nMaya ran with the opportunity. She took ownership of the experimentation process, brought in two other leads, and rolled it out thoughtfully. It quickly sped up decision-making, killed projects that weren’t worth pursuing, and saved us from over-investment. Within months, the process scaled to the entire Group and was being considered for adoption across the org.  \n\nAt the same time, she deepened her strategic impact. She defined the solution space for users on multiple teams, and she led the strategy for bringing Dropbox into business chat apps. Delegating craft quality gave her the headroom to operate at this higher level.  \n\n## The Outcome  \nMaya was motivated, happy, and visibly increasing her impact. She was leading process improvements that changed how the organization worked, while contributing strategy on high-priority projects. And as a cherry on top, she was promoted to Senior Design Manager.  \n\n> “High performers don’t just need praise—they need scope that matches their ambition.”  	t	2021-08-18 00:00:00	2025-09-05 12:37:58.900319	2025-09-05 12:45:52.736242	How I motivated a high-performing Design Manager by aligning her scope with her ambition for strategy and process.  	draftmotivating-high-performers-through-scope-and-strategy		In 2021 at Dropbox, I managed a high-performing Design Manager—let’s call her Maya—who wanted a promotion. Her core motivation was scope—she wanted to scale her impact in process and strategy. Together, we identified opportunities: she took ownership of a cross-group experimentation process and delegated craft responsibilities to a senior IC. The process she led scaled across the group, and her strategic contributions expanded into new areas. She was motivated, impactful, and ultimately promoted to Senior Design Manager. The lesson? High performers need scope that matches their ambition.  	The Challenge In Q2 of 2021, I was managing a high-performing Design Manager at Dropbox—let’s call her Maya. She excelled across the board—design process, strategy, craft, and communication. She led a team of four ICs and was respected by her peers. During a career conversation, Maya shared her desire for a promotion. Promotions can be motivating, but they’re not always in a manager’s control. My job was to ensure she felt supported, that her strengths were maximized, and that we aligned her day-to-day work with what truly motivated her. My Coaching Approach When coaching high performers, I focus on three things: Understand their core motivation Give them choices that align with that motivation Connect their work to visible progress toward it With Maya, it quickly became clear that her motivation was about scope. She wanted to scale her impact in strategy and process—those were the areas that energized her. We agreed that demonstrating those skills at scale would also improve her chances of promotion, even if the timing of that outcome wasn’t fully in our control. Finding the Right Opportunities Maya and I set aside time for a working session to brainstorm ways she could stretch her scope. We both brought ideas, and ultimately we chose two: She would own a cross-group process project focused on feature validation and experimentation. She would delegate craft quality responsibilities to a senior IC, which gave that person greater influence while freeing Maya to focus on strategy. We checked with cross-functional partners to ensure alignment and adjusted Maya’s goals to reflect these new responsibilities. From there, we set up monthly check-ins to track her progress. What Happened Next Maya ran with the opportunity. She took ownership of the experimentation process, brought in two other leads, and rolled it out thoughtfully. It quickly sped up decision-making, killed projects that weren’t worth pursuing, and saved us from over-investment. Within months, the process scaled to the entire Group and was being considered for adoption across the org. At the same time, she deepened her strategic impact. She defined the solution space for users on multiple teams, and she led the strategy for bringing Dropbox into business chat apps. Delegating craft quality gave her the headroom to operate at this higher level. The Outcome Maya was motivated, happy, and visibly increasing her impact. She was leading process improvements that changed how the organization worked, while contributing strategy on high-priority projects. And as a cherry on top, she was promoted to Senior Design Manager. > “High performers don’t just need praise—they need scope that matches their ambition.”	\N

We had three designers serving Growth Managers, and while the work was shipping, it wasn’t hitting the mark. ROI was low, and the designers were becoming demotivated.  \n\nThe data told the same story: we had hit a ceiling with our optimizations. Moving buttons and running endless A/B tests could only get us so far. Meanwhile, lead meetings and 1:1s made it clear—design wasn’t contributing strategically, and the team’s energy was draining.  \n\n## My Role  \nAs Design Manager, I needed to ensure that the solutions we shipped were impactful, that the designers on my team were growing, and that we were moving from a service model to embedded, strategic partners.  \n\n## Resetting the Approach  \nI started by diagnosing the issues: optimizations weren’t addressing real customer problems, designers were overloaded, and research was limited to evaluation rather than discovery.  \n\nFrom there, I set two principles:  \n- **Reserve time for bigger thinking**  \n- **Define problems collaboratively**  \n\nI aligned with my PM and Engineering partners and shifted our researcher to focus on foundational work. We sponsored a new study to uncover the unmet needs of people who abandoned onboarding. We knew when and where they dropped off—but not why.  \n\nIn parallel, I invested in usability tooling and process upgrades, and I carved out time for designers to think beyond incremental changes: one designer dedicated 20% of their time to future-focused work, while the other two committed 10% for two quarters.  \n\n## What We Found  \nThe research came back with striking insights. Half of the people who quit couldn’t identify which product they had tried. Many had landed in the Business SKU when they wanted something simpler—an expensive mismatch that didn’t meet their needs.  \n\nArmed with this insight, the designer who had future-focused time proposed a “right-sizing” solution: guiding users to the product that actually fit their needs. That project ran for about a year, reshaping how we matched customers to SKUs. It also spawned related initiatives—upgrade and downgrade flows, and even how we approached subscription cancellation.  \n\nThe partnership between design and product on that work became a model for collaboration across the org.  \n\n## The Outcome  \nBy listening to designer sentiment, digging into the data, and sponsoring the right research, we were able to get design involved in strategy in a meaningful way. The designers were more engaged, their contributions grew in impact, and the company benefited from more thoughtful activation and acquisition solutions.  \n\n> “We knew when and where they quit—but not why.”  \n	t	2020-01-20 00:00:00	2025-09-05 12:51:57.643684	2025-09-05 13:02:50.893903	How I shifted Growth design at Dropbox from incremental optimizations to strategic, impactful work.  	getting-design-involved-in-strategy		In 2019 at Dropbox, my Growth design team was stuck in low-ROI optimizations, and designers were losing motivation. I shifted our approach: we carved out time for strategic thinking, sponsored foundational research, and aligned with PM and engineering partners. The study revealed that half of churned users couldn’t identify which product they’d tried—many had landed in the wrong SKU. That insight led to a “right-sizing” project that reshaped onboarding, upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations. The lesson? When design contributes to strategy by defining the problem, the impact is exponentially greater.

80	A Simple Framework for Building Impactful Relationships 	Strong relationships between design, engineering, and product leadership don’t happen by accident. They’re built with intention. Over time, I’ve found that the most impactful partnerships I’ve had—whether with PMs, engineers, or other leaders—follow a simple three-step framework:  \n\n1. **Set expectations**  \n2. **Understand motivators**  \n3. **Achieve together**  \n\n## Step 1: Set Expectations  \nClarity comes first. The best relationships begin with a clear understanding of how you’ll work together. What’s expected of each role? Where are decisions made? What’s the shared rhythm?  \n\nBy setting expectations early, you reduce ambiguity and make sure nobody is guessing at their responsibilities.  \n\n## Step 2: Understand Motivators  \nEvery leader brings different motivations to the table. Some thrive on efficiency. Others care most about scale, innovation, or customer experience. Taking the time to learn what excites your partner—and what drains them—creates a foundation of trust.  \n\nWhen you know someone’s motivators, you can align opportunities that play to their strengths and keep them engaged.  \n\n## Step 3: Achieve Together  \nNothing builds a relationship faster than shared success. Once expectations are clear and motivators are understood, the next step is to deliver something meaningful together. That achievement creates momentum, trust, and a track record you can build on.  \n\nBig or small, the key is that the win is shared. You both own it.  \n\n## Why This Works  \nThis framework has helped me again and again—whether welcoming a new engineering manager, collaborating with a product leader, or aligning with executives. It takes relationships from transactional to strategic.  \n\nIt’s simple, but powerful:  \n- Set expectations so you’re aligned.  \n- Understand motivators so you’re connected.  \n- Achieve together so you’re invested.  \n\n> “Relationships grow strongest when they’re built on clarity, trust, and shared wins.”  	t	2025-08-12 00:00:00	2025-09-05 14:03:23.658622	2025-09-05 14:06:57.110137	A simple three-step framework for building impactful cross-functional relationships: set expectations, understand motivators, achieve together.  \n	a-simple-framework-for-building-impactful-relationships		Strong relationships across design, engineering, and product don’t happen by chance—they’re built with intention.

79	Building Strong Relationships Between Engineering and Design  	## The Foundation  \nIn my experience, the two tactics that have worked best in forging strong engineering–design relationships are **investing in shared language** and **practicing inclusion**.  \n\nShared language means we can talk clearly about the same constraints, trade-offs, and technical challenges. Inclusion means giving engineers a voice in product and design strategy—not just inviting them to the meeting, but making real space for them to contribute.  \n\nOver time, I’ve developed a simple framework for building impactful relationships:  \n\n1. **Set expectations**  \n2. **Understand each other’s motivators**  \n3. **Achieve together**  \n\n> “The best engineering relationships I’ve had were never about the delegation of solutions.

That expectation set the tone: he wasn’t just there to execute, he was there to shape strategy with us.  \n\n## Step 2: Understand Motivators  \nRather than rushing him into process, I spent time learning what motivated Alex. What did he care about? Where did he find energy? What did he see as his responsibility?  \n\nIt became clear that efficiency and scale were what lit him up. As an engineering leader, he wanted to make systems run better and remove waste. That gave us an opening to align strategy with his core motivators.  \n\n## Step 3: Achieve Together  \nStrategically, we identified a major opportunity: migrating from two code bases to one. It was exactly the kind of efficiency play Alex cared about, but instead of treating it as an engineering clean-up task, we reframed it as a product initiative. Together, we sized the impact from the customer, product, and business perspectives.  \n\nThat framing energized Alex. He saw the initiative not just as engineering work, but as strategic impact. We delivered it as a team, reducing engineering time, simplifying maintenance, and freeing capacity. More importantly, we built trust.  \n\nWith that trust in place, I was able to ask Alex for support in other areas, and he leaned in with confidence.

82	Building Product Partnerships Through Trust and Innovation	When attrition and a mid-year reorg reshuffled responsibilities in 2019, I found myself with a new product lead, someone I’d never worked with before. Let’s call her Dana. Dana was known for her execution-focused approach, while I came in with a design background full of 0→1 experience. We were different, and that could have gone either way.  \n\n## Setting Expectations Together  \n\nThe first thing I suggested was collaborative expectation-setting. Instead of me writing a list of responsibilities and Dana doing the same, we did it together. We wrote down everything we thought we owned, then compared notes to find gaps and overlaps. That gave us not just alignment, but a shared language for how we’d work.  \n\nFrom there, I leaned on a simple framework I use for new partnerships: *understand, achieve, grow*. First, get to know each other’s motivators. Next, pick a project to knock out together. Finally, support each other’s growth.  \n\n## Finding Shared Motivators  \n\nIn those early strategy sessions, I learned Dana had a passion for innovation. She wanted to take bigger risks. That opened the door. I shared some of my favorite design tools—Design Sprints, Forum Traversing, Ritual Dissent—and we started to imagine what “innovation practice” could look like in our area.  \n\nInstead of me leading, we decided to experiment together. We piloted a variation on the GV Design Sprint with two teams. The results were both actionable and morale-boosting. Dana was energized, and so was I.  \n\n## From Experiments to Practice  \n\nOne experiment led to another.

Instead of diving straight into delivery, we started by setting expectations together—literally writing down our responsibilities and comparing notes. That gave us alignment and a shared language. Then I focused on understanding her motivators. She cared deeply about innovation, so we experimented together, running design sprints and eventually launching an “innovation week” that became a quarterly ritual. The results were real: actionable product changes, higher morale, and a codified practice for the whole area. But more importantly, we built trust. The lesson for me was clear: strong product partnerships are built by setting expectations, understanding motivators, and creating wins together.  	When attrition and a mid-year reorg reshuffled responsibilities in 2019, I found myself with a new product lead, someone I’d never worked with before. Let’s call her Dana. Dana was known for her execution-focused approach, while I came in with a design background full of 0→1 experience. We were different, and that could have gone either way. Setting Expectations Together The first thing I suggested was collaborative expectation-setting. Instead of me writing a list of responsibilities and Dana doing the same, we did it together. We wrote down everything we thought we owned, then compared notes to find gaps and overlaps. That gave us not just alignment, but a shared language for how we’d work. From there, I leaned on a simple framework I use for new partnerships: understand, achieve, grow . First, get to know each other’s motivators. Next, pick a project to knock out together. Finally, support each other’s growth. Finding Shared Motivators In those early strategy sessions, I learned Dana had a passion for innovation. She wanted to take bigger risks. That opened the door. I shared some of my favorite design tools—Design Sprints, Forum Traversing, Ritual Dissent—and we started to imagine what “innovation practice” could look like in our area. Instead of me leading, we decided to experiment together. We piloted a variation on the GV Design Sprint with two teams. The results were both actionable and morale-boosting. Dana was energized, and so was I. From Experiments to Practice One experiment led to another. We introduced new exercises, piloted an “innovation week,” and eventually made it a quarterly ritual. Dana even codified the practice in our area, giving it permanence. Along the way, we not only shipped forward-thinking product changes—we built trust. Strong product partnerships are built by setting expectations, understanding motivators, and creating wins together. What started as a reorg challenge became one of the most successful collaborations of my time at Dropbox. Not because we were the same, but because we learned how to complement each other.	
31	Improving Solution Value	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, a couple of our solutions in emerging spaces had fallen flat. One of the riskiest bets, a time-tracking feature, absorbed design energy but failed to resonate. As a manager, my responsibility wasn’t just to help ship better solutions—it was also to help my designers grow. That meant taking a closer look at why our work was missing the mark, and how we could adjust.  \n\n## Diagnosing What Went Wrong\nWhat I found was simple, but telling. Designers were moving fast, but at the expense of value validation. They focused on polishing user experience while skipping over the deeper question: *was this even worth building?* The investment was measured only in design time, not in business or customer impact.  \n\n## A Framework for Change\nTo course-correct, I leaned on a familiar framework: diagnosis, principles, actions. The diagnosis was clear—we were skipping the hard work of testing for value. The principles I introduced were designed to shift our mindset: scope to impact, show your work so others can give feedback early, and break things down before running too far ahead. The actions followed naturally: assess the risk level of each project, align on the design time required, document and share the design process, and validate value for medium-to-large efforts before committing.  \n\n## Putting It Into Practice\nOne designer translated these principles into “plans of action,” lightweight but transparent documents that showed how design work would unfold. This transparency invited PMs and stakeholders in earlier and built accountability across the team. Another designer led “concept testing,” structured sessions to validate value before investing in execution. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, feedback came in earlier, and concept testing became a staple in critiques.  \n\n## The Shift We Saw\nThe results were immediate. Riskier projects were tested for value upfront, leading to early pivots instead of late scrambles. Loosely defined problems sharpened into specific needs—“time tracking” reframed as “help me get paid,” which ultimately became “create me an invoice.” PMs started engaging more deeply in the design process, and designers themselves began sharing new methods, turning these initial fixes into cultural habits. Our solutions became smaller, more validated, and far less risky.  \n\n> “By slowing down just enough to validate value, we actually sped up the path to solutions that mattered.”  \n\n## What I Took Away\nLooking back, I realized that frameworks give teams clarity, transparency builds accountability, and testing for value must come before polishing design. Most importantly, leadership wasn’t about having all the answers. It was about creating the conditions for the team to ask the right questions—and follow them to better outcomes.  \n\n	t	2023-09-16 00:00:00	2025-09-01 02:59:11.608551	2025-09-12 04:49:53.692632	How I helped my team move beyond polishing solutions to validating value first—turning failed bets into a culture of sharper, less risky design.	improving-solution-value		In 2022, a few of our design bets at Dropbox fell flat—time tracking being the clearest example. Designers were moving fast, but skipping the hardest question: was this even valuable? I introduced a simple framework—diagnosis, principles, actions—and new habits followed: lightweight “plans of action” to make work transparent, and concept testing to validate value before building. The shift was dramatic. Risky ideas pivoted earlier, vague problems sharpened into clear needs, and PMs engaged more deeply in the process. The lesson for me was clear: when you slow down just enough to validate value, you actually speed up the path to solutions that matter.

114	Shaping Strategy Through Targeted Activation  	At the start of 2021, it became clear that our activation strategy at Dropbox was losing steam.

24	Designing for AI Interactions: Input, Output, and Reward	When designing for AI, there are three essential parts of the interaction we need to consider: **the input, the output, and the reward.**  \n\n**The input** is the information a user sends to the machine.  \n**The output** is the machine’s response back to the user.  \n**The reward** is what the user does in response to the output—essentially, a second input that either reinforces or challenges the system.  \n\nThese interactions can be **overt** or **hidden.** Overt inputs and rewards are intentional: typing into a chat box, clicking “thumbs up,” or asking for a regenerated response. Hidden ones are unintentional: behavioral data like how long a user lingers, where they drop off, or what they ignore. Both feed the system and shape future outputs.  \n\n## Why the Use Case Matters  \n\nThe use case ultimately determines how we design the inputs, outputs, and rewards. For example, take [ChatGPT’s chat](https://chat.openai.com). The real purpose of the product isn’t just to answer questions—it’s to learn how people interact with conversational AI and train the model.  \n\n- **Input:** a user types into an open text box with little guidance.  \n- **Output:** the AI responds with text.  \n- **Reward:** the user can copy the output, rate it up or down, ask for a regeneration, reply with a new prompt, or simply leave.  \n\nThe design is beautifully simple, but perfectly suited for the use case: learning from interaction at scale.  \n\n## Exploring Just the Input  \n\nLet’s imagine a hypothetical case: “find the best restaurant near me.” There are endless ways we could design the input alone:  \n\n- A plain text box where the user types: *“find the best restaurant near zip code 10001.”*  \n- A text box with built-in suggestions to guide phrasing, paired with a hidden input that auto-detects location.  \n- A palette builder where users select favorite cuisines, plus a hidden location input that’s bundled into the prompt.  \n- Even an upload flow where users share photos of past meals they loved, combined with location detection.  \n\nEach of these designs changes the interaction—and changes what the AI learns in return.  \n\n## The Bigger Opportunity  \n\nNone of this is new in principle, but what’s new is the power of today’s language models. The possibilities for interaction design are richer than ever, and our responsibility as designers is to create experiences that are transparent, valuable, and joyful.  \n\nSo whether you’re designing inputs, shaping outputs, or defining rewards, remember: you’re not just shaping an interface—you’re shaping how people and machines learn from one another.  \n\nHave fun designing. 😃  	t	2023-05-17 00:00:00	2023-05-17 14:43:28.996089	2025-09-12 05:01:26.816907	How product designers can think about AI interactions through the lens of input, output, and reward—both overt and hidden.	designing-for-ai-interactions-input-output-and-reward		When you design for AI, every interaction comes down to three parts: the input, the output, and the reward. The input is what the user sends to the machine. The output is what comes back. And the reward is how the user responds—whether that’s clicking, rating, or re-engaging. Some of these are overt, like typing into a text box or giving a thumbs up. Others are hidden, like dwell time or drop-offs. Together, they shape how the AI learns. Take ChatGPT’s chat: the input is an open text box, the output is a text response, and the reward is everything the user does afterward—copying, rating, regenerating, or leaving. It’s a simple design, but perfectly suited for training the model. The lesson? Inputs, outputs, and rewards aren’t just mechanics; they’re levers. And with today’s more powerful models, designers have an opportunity to make those interactions more transparent, valuable, and joyful.\n	When designing for AI, there are three essential parts of the interaction we need to consider: the input, the output, and the reward.

115	Designing for Customers, Not Just Metrics	Metrics can tell you where to focus, but they can’t tell you how the work feels to a customer. Too often, teams fall into the trap of optimizing for numbers alone—pushing buttons into modals, forcing clicks, nudging behaviors—while forgetting the experience those numbers represent.  \n\nI faced this head-on while leading activation design at Dropbox. The challenge wasn’t just to move the metric—it was to bring the customer back into the process.  \n\n---\n\n## The Problem  \n\nOur team’s focus was activation. Data pointed us toward opportunities like increasing team member invites. The solutions we were exploring? Growthy quick fixes, like forcing the invite button into a modal during onboarding. They might have bumped numbers, but they weren’t designed with the customer’s experience in mind.  \n\nOur approach lacked customer focus, and I knew it would eventually hurt both the user journey and the business.  \n\n---\n\n## The Approach  \n\nBecause research bandwidth was thin, I decided to bring customer focus directly into the design team’s practice. My research partner and I asked product design ICs to take ownership of customer conversations themselves.  \n\nWe created a lightweight ritual: every two weeks, a design IC would lead a competitive onboarding audit. They’d share their observations with the design team, our researcher, and one or two non-design partners who would challenge assumptions. The point wasn’t to copy features—it was to extract **principles** from what worked elsewhere.  \n\nThe team drew inspiration from everywhere—Fortnite, Spotify, even the experience of getting into a Tesla. Designers then built prototypes that highlighted those principles, which we tested with users. With research support, we focused conversations on **sentiment and principles**, not just tasks.  \n\n---\n\n## The Principles  \n\nFrom this ritual, the team distilled principles that became touchstones for our work:  \n\n1. **Give the customer control.**  \n2. **Be transparent.**  \n3. **Give more than you take.**  \n\nBy rooting our designs in these principles, the team shifted its mindset. Instead of just asking, *How do we increase invites?* they started asking, *How does this feel for the customer?*  \n\n---\n\n## The Results  \n\nThe impact was clear. Designers were more aligned.

While leading activation design at Dropbox, I noticed our team was leaning on growth hacks—like forcing invite buttons into modals—that might bump numbers but lacked customer focus. Because we had limited research bandwidth, I asked designers to own customer conversations directly.  \n\nWe built a simple ritual: every two weeks, a designer audited another product’s onboarding, shared insights with the team, and pulled out principles. With input from cross-functional partners and follow-up user testing, we focused our work on principles like giving the customer control, being transparent, and giving more than you take.  \n\nThe shift was powerful. Designers aligned around customer experience, not just metrics, and the solutions we shipped were more thoughtful and resilient. The big lesson? Metrics measure outcomes, but principles guide experiences—and it’s the balance of the two that creates lasting impact.
