When everyone understands the "why" behind their work and feels empowered to contribute, it leads to innovative solutions and a more cohesive team dynamic.	answer	\N	{"knowledge_base_influence": {"sources": [{"id": 92, "title": "Balancing Speed and Quality", "category": "Blog Post", "confidence": "90.0", "word_matches": ["build", "teams"], "content_snippet": "5 years for completion\\n- **Goal**: Validate feasibility before committing significant resources\\n\\n## Task\\n\\n- Ship something quickly to validate continued investment in the ambitious idea\\n- Gather evidence to support solution direction\\n- Persuade other teams to prioritize and support the project\\n\\n## Action\\n\\n### Initial Resistance\\n\\n- During a crucial area-leads-to-group-leads meeting, an EM and PDM insisted it needed to be a big project\\n- Technical risk was perceived as huge to get it right\\n- I immediately challenged the \\"no\\" response\\n\\n### Strategic Intervention\\n\\n- With support from partners, I pushed for \\"break it down, regardless of risk\\"\\n- Asked EM, PM, and PDM to present scope of risk instead of blocking\\n- Team returned with not only risk scope but solutions to each one\\n\\n### Risk Mitigation Examples\\n\\n- Instead of building for each platform, they'd use a small Beta group\\n- Used good communication and design to set expectations\\n- Challenged team to present what they could validate in just six weeks\\n\\n### Speed as Constraint\\n\\n- Framed speed as a constraint to push the idea forward\\n- Validated potential without massive upfront investment\\n- Engineering Manager Abraham took the challenge and created a plan\\n\\n## Result\\n\\n### Breakthroughs Achieved\\n\\n- Designers broke down problem and scope into manageable parts\\n- Engineers identified specific constraints and dependencies that could be avoided\\n- Instead of complete solution for new membership types, rolled out alpha version to select willing adopters\\n\\n### Platform Strategy\\n\\n- Acknowledged certain benefits wouldn't work on certain platforms (mobile, desktop, tablet)\\n- Team reduced estimated timeline and dependencies\\n- Delivered scrappy alpha for specific customers\\n\\n### Quality Focus\\n\\n- When only a portion of work was valuable, they could hone in on quality\\n- Allowed scaling impact because the solution was so useful\\n- Demonstrated that speed constraints can lead to better quality outcomes\\n\\n## Key Lessons\\n\\n1", "relevance_score": 100}, {"id": 113, "title": "Leadership Lessons from Product Design", "category": "Blog Post", "confidence": "90.0", "word_matches": ["build", "teams"], "content_snippet": "## Team Development\\n\\n### Building Strong Teams\\n\\n- Pull in the right people for specific challenges\\n- Create opportunities for growth and learning\\n- Foster collaboration between designers and product managers\\n\\n### Coaching Techniques\\n\\n- Use frameworks to push teams beyond obvious solutions\\n- Encourage exploration of multiple approaches\\n- Help teams reframe problems to be more ambitious\\n\\n## Strategic Alignment\\n\\n### Executive Communication\\n\\n- Present evidence-backed innovation proposals\\n- Position design work as strategic differentiators\\n- Secure alignment before major initiatives\\n\\n### Navigating Change\\n\\n- Guide teams through strategic pivots\\n- Maintain vision while adjusting execution\\n- Ensure continuity during organizational changes", "relevance_score": 100}], "avg_relevance": 100, "sources_count": 2, "raw_confidence": "90.0", "influence_level": "high", "confidence_score": "90.0", "has_knowledge_base_content": true}}	2025-09-01 03:32:45.202294	2025-09-01 03:32:45.202294

90	Design Sprint Map for Heroes	==The [design sprint] is a tool to identify the biggest potential risk in your product and to design a solution around it.== As a fan of the Google Ventures sprint model, I wanted to share a somewhat detailed summary of one of the first steps: the sprint map.\r\n\r\n## The Sprint Map\r\n\r\nThe sprint map should be done on the first day. ==This map will be your guiding light throughout the sprint process. It will help keep you on topic and your idea focused on the part of your product where you can make the biggest difference.== As an added benefit, the construction of the map will get the entire team thinking together and committed to the process.\r\n\r\n### What you need:\r\n\r\n* 1 hour\r\n* A sprint facilitator\r\n* The dedicated attention of the sprint team\r\n* Whiteboard\r\n* Whiteboard markers\r\n\r\n### How to draw the map:\r\n\r\nThe facilitator is responsible for collecting the teams thoughts on the whiteboard.  They should try their best to avoid interpreting the team's thoughts, but if and when they do, they should be sure to ask the team "does this look right?". ==It is important that the facilitator makes sure that the team's thoughts are captured, and the result is not just the interpretation or ideas of the facilitator.==\r\n\r\nAs the facilitator stands at the whiteboard, they should help the team through\r\nthe steps of creating the map:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Left to right\r\n\r\nOn the far left side of the whiteboard, list the characters that will be most prominent in this story. ==I try to think of the map as the quest of a hero. There is the hero with a goal, and all of the integral characters they meet along the way.== Sometimes the story can break into side stories of the supporting characters, but in the end it revolves around our hero.\r\n\r\nJot down the characters on the left starting with the hero. Write who they will meet along their journey in stack formation (in order top to bottom) to complete their goal. Typically there are 2-4 characters.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-characters%402x.png)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Far right\r\n\r\nThe far right is the goal of our hero. ==The end goal is the something that our hero is trying to attain. It is usually something tangible or service oriented.== For instance: the hero wants a meal, a bicycle route, a recommendation for the best seats at the opera. The more concise this is, the easier the map will be to create (and to be honest, the entire product).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-goal%402x.png)\r\n\r\n#### 3. Map the journey\r\n\r\nThe final step is to map all of the happenings between the hero and the goal. When the hero meets a key character along the way we can write this key step as the action of the key character or the overarching result of their interaction. This journey should involve all of the key characters and their role in the journey.  If a key character doesn't participate in this path then they should be removed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-complete%402x.png)\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\n* Keep the map simple. Try to limit the journey to no more than 20 happenings.\r\n* Try to limit the amount of characters to 4\r\n* Get the group involved. Make sure the entire team is participating. As each step is drawn, ask the room "does this look right?"\r\n* Don't be afraid to erase. This process is flexible. Keep erasing or writing new ideas until it feels right.\r\n\r\n[design sprint]:http://www.gv.com/sprint/\r\n	Blog Post	#process	0.9	post_6	2023-07-14 18:04:45.111303	2025-09-01 03:09:32.056096	2025-09-01 03:09:32.056096
91	The Action	==The second step to creating a lean experiment is identifying the user's action\r\nthat that can validate or invalidate your assumption.== This action can\r\ntake place in your application or completely outside of it.\r\n\r\nIf your assumption states that a user needs X, what action does that user\r\ndemonstrate to get X? If your users won't do Y, what action do take to avoid Y?\r\n==Ideally you want to find a real "currency" exchange and get the user\r\ncomplete the action.== Something that is of value to the user.\r\n\r\n==The user action should be measurable== otherwise you will not be able to\r\nidentify success or failure of your experiment. I find it easiest to measure\r\nactions in occurrences.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Our users don't trust our application with their bank information.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users enter their bank information in our application.\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Our users need verbal support to run further.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users run further.\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Our users want the convenience of a one-click grocery buy.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users click a buy now button.\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Users want to share their music with other users.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users click a share button.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nTry to think of the simplest action a user could take to validate or invalidate\r\nyour assumption. It doesn't always have to be in your application, but typically\r\nit is more difficult to measure an action outside of your application. ==It\r\nshould feel obvious to you what action a user will take that gives you\r\nvalidation.==\r\n	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experiment	0.9	post_3	2023-07-14 18:05:10.801051	2025-09-01 03:09:32.063854	2025-09-01 03:09:32.063854
92	Balancing Speed and Quality	# Balancing Speed and Quality\n\n## Overview\n\nI led my team to deliver a scrappy alpha version of a challenging project, validating its feasibility without a large upfront investment. This approach demonstrated how to balance speed and quality through strategic constraint-setting and risk management.\n\n## Situation\n\n- **Timeline**: Q3, 2022\n- **Project**: New license type called "Flexible licensing"\n- **Challenge**: Team estimated 1 to 1.5 years for completion\n- **Goal**: Validate feasibility before committing significant resources\n\n## Task\n\n- Ship something quickly to validate continued investment in the ambitious idea\n- Gather evidence to support solution direction\n- Persuade other teams to prioritize and support the project\n\n## Action\n\n### Initial Resistance\n\n- During a crucial area-leads-to-group-leads meeting, an EM and PDM insisted it needed to be a big project\n- Technical risk was perceived as huge to get it right\n- I immediately challenged the "no" response\n\n### Strategic Intervention\n\n- With support from partners, I pushed for "break it down, regardless of risk"\n- Asked EM, PM, and PDM to present scope of risk instead of blocking\n- Team returned with not only risk scope but solutions to each one\n\n### Risk Mitigation Examples\n\n- Instead of building for each platform, they'd use a small Beta group\n- Used good communication and design to set expectations\n- Challenged team to present what they could validate in just six weeks\n\n### Speed as Constraint\n\n- Framed speed as a constraint to push the idea forward\n- Validated potential without massive upfront investment\n- Engineering Manager Abraham took the challenge and created a plan\n\n## Result\n\n### Breakthroughs Achieved\n\n- Designers broke down problem and scope into manageable parts\n- Engineers identified specific constraints and dependencies that could be avoided\n- Instead of complete solution for new membership types, rolled out alpha version to select willing adopters\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\n- Acknowledged certain benefits wouldn't work on certain platforms (mobile, desktop, tablet)\n- Team reduced estimated timeline and dependencies\n- Delivered scrappy alpha for specific customers\n\n### Quality Focus\n\n- When only a portion of work was valuable, they could hone in on quality\n- Allowed scaling impact because the solution was so useful\n- Demonstrated that speed constraints can lead to better quality outcomes\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n1. **Challenge assumptions** - Don't accept "no" without exploring alternatives\n2. **Use constraints strategically** - Speed limitations can force better prioritization\n3. **Break down complex problems** - Manageable parts are easier to validate\n4. **Focus on validation first** - Prove value before perfecting\n5. **Leverage willing adopters** - Beta groups can accelerate learning\n6. **Quality emerges from constraints** - Limited scope often leads to better solutions	Blog Post	#speed, #quality, #validation, #riskmanagement, #teamleadership, #projectmanagement	0.9	post_30	2025-09-01 02:59:11.489504	2025-09-01 03:09:32.069511	2025-09-01 03:09:32.069511
93	Improving Solution Value	# Improving Solution Value\n\n## Overview\n\n**Owner:** Jason  \n**Company:** Dropbox  \n**Year:** 2022  \n**Status:** Done  \n**Quality:** Great  \n\n## The Challenge\n\n**Tell me about a time that you improved your design teams performance?**\n\nSolutions weren't impactful, so I diagnosed the problem and introduced concept testing.\n\n## Situation\n\n**Q2 2022 at Dropbox**\n\nA couple solutions had fallen flat, so I leaned in to understand why. The solutions were all in nascent spaces (Admin action, and Freelancer Tooling).\n\n## Task\n\nMy role was to assist the design team in developing effective solutions. In addition, it's to develop the skills of my reports.\n\n## Action\n\nI follow a framework for problems — **diagnosis, principles, actions**.\n\n### Diagnosis Phase\nI focused on the riskiest problem "Time Tracking" that fell flat. I found that designers were trying to move fast. They were skipping understanding value and focusing on UX. They weren't thinking about ROI, just the time it was taking — the investment.\n\nI conferred with the designers, my PM partner, their PM partners, and their managers.\n\n### Principles Established\nLeveraging my diagnosis, I drafted principles and actions:\n\n**Principle — Scope to impact**  \n**Principle — Show your work;** transparent plans of action so others can give early feedback.  \n**Principle — Break it down**\n\n### Actions Implemented\n**Action — Identify risk with each project.**  \n**Action — Align on design time needed.**  \n**Action — Document design process and communicate it to your partners.**  \n**Action — Test value for medium + sized projects.**\n\n### Team Implementation\n- **Carolina led the "plans of action"** - Aimed for transparency, ROI, and accountability.\n- **Introduced the process to the team** - Teams shared "plans of action" openly.\n- **Christina led "concept testing"** - Conducted concept testing learning sessions.\n- **Designers incorporated concepts into critiques.**\n\n## Result\n\n### Immediate Impact\nOn riskier projects, designers were testing for value using concept testing. Some projects pivoted or broke up based on concept testing findings.\n\n### Problem Refinement\nLoosely defined problems became more specific and centered on customer value. For example "time tracking" went to "help me get paid" and then "create me an invoice".\n\n### Process Adoption\n- PMs interacted with the action plans becoming more interested in design process.\n- Designers actively shared other process ideas and exercises.\n- Concept testing and plans of action became part of the design team's toolset.\n\n### Overall Improvement\nOur solutions in general were smaller, more validated, and less risky.\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n### Framework Approach\nThe **diagnosis → principles → actions** framework proved effective for systematic problem-solving.\n\n### Value-First Thinking\nMoving from UX-focused to value-focused solutions significantly improved impact and ROI.\n\n### Process Transparency\nMaking design processes visible to partners increased collaboration and alignment.\n\n### Concept Testing\nEarly validation through concept testing reduced risk and improved solution quality.\n\n## Application\n\nThis approach can be applied to any design team struggling with:\n- Solutions that don't deliver expected impact\n- Teams moving too fast without proper validation\n- Lack of alignment between design and business goals\n- Need for more systematic problem-solving approaches	Blog Post	#design, #problemsolving, #process, #teamperformance, #concepttesting, #roi	0.9	post_31	2025-09-01 02:59:11.608551	2025-09-01 03:09:32.075487	2025-09-01 03:09:32.075487
94	Lego MVP Warm-up	As Product Designers we build MVPs often. To help get into the mindset of "minimum and viable" I like to play a game with a couple people that forces prioritization.

They cannot talk. \r\n- Go around the table clockwise, one person at a time, guessing what the piece is.\r\n- If someone gets it right, the game stops.\r\n- Once everyone has guessed the game stops.\r\n\r\n*Note - if you think the person built what you added to the hat, don’t guess.\r\n\r\n## Scoring\r\n- If your presentation was guessed correctly by anyone, you get points. \r\n- If you guess the presentation, you get points.\r\n\r\n|| Number of legos | Presenter Points | Guesser Points ||\r\n|-| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |-|\r\n|| 10              | 1                 | 1                        ||\r\n|| 9                | 2                 | 2                        ||\r\n|| 8                | 3                 | 3                        ||\r\n|| 7                | 4                 | 4                        ||\r\n|| 6                | 5                 | 5                        ||\r\n|| 5                | 6                 | 6                        ||\r\n|| 4                | 7                 | 7                        ||\r\n|| 3                | 8                 | 8                        ||\r\n|| 2                | 9                 | 9                        ||\r\n|| 1                | 10               | 10                      ||	Blog Post	#process, #fun	0.9	post_25	2023-05-31 17:58:14.130463	2025-09-01 03:09:32.081781	2025-09-01 03:09:32.081781
95	Blind App Review	I was recently given the prompt in an interview to "evaluate, provide feedback on creative work, and communicate improvements on design". It's a robust prompt — and it came in the form a a blind app review focused on the creative conception of a product. I love it. A big part of being a designer is being able to give critical feedback and recognize areas for improvement. \r\n\r\nI wanted to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. My goal was to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can help create a better product.  \r\n\r\nHere is the approach I took:\r\n\r\n# My Approach\r\n\r\n1. [Say Hi](#say-hi)\r\n1. [Intro The Process](#intro-the-process)\r\n1. [Familiarize](#familiarize)\r\n1. [Evaluate UI/UX](#evaluate-ui-ux)\r\n1. [Analyze Brand Expression](#analyze-brand-expression)\r\n1. [Assess Aesthetics And Taste](#assess-aethetics-and-taste)\r\n1. [Identify The Good And Bad](#identify-the-good-and-bad)\r\n1. [Propose Changes](#propose-changes)\r\n<div class="u-padding-bottom-x-large"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="say-hi"></a>\r\n## 1. Say Hi \r\n\r\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the pressure, and challenge, of an interview - let alone a blind app review. Start off slow, say hi, and show your warmth first.  Don’t forget that you're working with another person. Demonstrating your expertise is great, and showing how you include others and leverage the skills around you is a multiplier. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="intro-the-process"></a>\r\n## 2. Intro The Process\r\n\r\nIntroduce the interviewer(s) to your process. Show them you have one, and let them follow along.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="familiarize"></a>\r\n## 3. Familiarize\r\n\r\nSpend some time exploring and interacting with the app. This will help you understand its functionalities, user interface (UI), and user experience (UX).\r\n\r\n- What is your first impression?\r\n- What are the positive aspects?\r\n- What immediately jumps out that can be improved?\r\n- What you think the main jobs-to-be-done or problems solved are?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="evaluate-ui-ux"></a>\r\n## 4. Evaluate UI/UX\r\n\r\nAssess the visual elements, layout, and overall user interface design of the app. \r\n\r\n- Is the interface intuitive and easy to navigate?\r\n- Are the buttons, icons, and other interactive elements clear and understandable?\r\n- Does the app provide feedback and guidance to the user effectively?\r\n- Does the app follow established UI/UX design principles?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="analyze-brand-expression"></a>\r\n## 5. Analyze Brand Expression\r\nEvaluate how well the app communicates and represents its brand.\r\n\r\n- Is the branding consistent throughout the app?\r\n- Does the app reflect the brand's values and tone?\r\n- Does the app reflect the brand's identity?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="assess-aesthetics-and-taste"></a>\r\n## 6. Assess Aesthetics And Taste\r\nEvaluate the overall visual appeal and style of the app. Consider the following questions:\r\n\r\n- Is the app visually pleasing and engaging?\r\n- Does the color scheme, typography, and graphics enhance the user experience?\r\n- Does the app align with current design trends or demonstrate a unique and innovative approach?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="identify-the-good-and-bad"></a>\r\n## 7. Identify The Good And Bad\r\nBased on your evaluation, pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the app. Focus on the end user experience.\r\n\r\n- What aspects of the app are working well and enhancing the user experience?\r\n- What aspects could be improved to make the app more user-friendly, efficient, or enjoyable?\r\n- Are there any usability issues or pain points that should be addressed?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="propose-changes"></a>\r\n## 8. Propose Changes\r\nOffer specific recommendations for improvements based on your evaluation. <mark>Try proposing in the form of problem solving approaches as well.</mark>\r\n\r\n- How would you address the identified issues or challenges?\r\n- What changes would you suggest to enhance the app's UI, UX, brand expression, or aesthetics?\r\n- How can the app better solve problems or meet the needs of the end user?\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="u-padding-bottom-x-large"></div>\r\n\r\nTry to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. Your goal is to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can create a better product.\r\n\r\n# 🤞	Blog Post	#process, #interview	0.9	post_26	2023-07-12 19:29:42.376941	2025-09-01 03:09:32.087305	2025-09-01 03:09:32.087305
96	Validation Early On	\r\nIn the early stages of your product journey, you won't much (if any) data that suggest your product will be a success. However, ==you should have confidence that there is a potential business behind the problem you are solving, and that other people want that problem solved.==\r\n\r\nIf you feel that sense of confidence, you should continue to move forward and spend energy on gathering quantitative information that there are more than 5-10 potential customers. Think of this as high-level market research. ==We want to gather quantitative data to build more confidence that there is a market interested in your unique value proposition.==\r\n\r\nWe want to put our idea in front of as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and learn if those people resonate with the problem we are solving and the unique value proposition. There are three questions we want to answer:\r\n\r\n* How many potential customers identify with the problem?\r\n* How many potential customers will investigate into solutions?\r\n* How many potential customers will commit to a currency exchange for a solution?\r\n\r\nTo answer the above questions, we can run a variety of experiments that reach a large audience, elicit a behavior from individuals that demonstrate an interest in your unique value proposition, and solicit a currency exchange from individuals in that audience to demonstrates a willingness to pay for a solution.\r\n\r\nAssuming you have already done your customer development (if not, get out of the building!), a next good step might be the [Google Keywords](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/validation-with-google-keywords) research method. This should help you build more confidence that a larger audience is looking for a solution to the problem you want to solve. A more advanced experiment to get a far better sense of validation is the [Facebook/AdWords Ad Experiment](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/validation-with-facebook-ads). Probably the best validation experiment you can run is the [Fake Door](https://data36.com/fake-door-testing/) experiment. \r\n\r\n==Most products fail because nobody wants them.== Don't be that person - do some customer development and idea validation before you spend so much of your valuable time building something nobody is going to use. \r\n	Blog Post	#lean, #experiment	0.9	post_19	2023-07-14 18:01:29.498435	2025-09-01 03:09:32.092915	2025-09-01 03:09:32.092915
97	Validation with Google Keywords	One of the quickest methods to gain confidence in your product is the [Google Aords Keyword Planner Tool](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/) <mark>You can leverage it to get real data that shows how often people are searching the problem you hope to solve.</mark> \r\n\r\n## Example: \r\n\r\nYou want to deliver emoji-cupcakes because you felt that there was a lack of bakeries that offered them. After some research, you've learned that this is true in your region. You've talked to 10 people who also feel the same way, and would love an emoji-cupcake delivery service. During your conversations with them, you also uncovered a new problem. Of those who ordered emoji-cupcakes in the past, the ordering process is complex and the variety limiting. \r\n\r\nYou're feeling pretty good about this, and you want some more validation. This is where the Google Adwords Keyword Planner tool comes in. Let's run an experiment.\r\n\r\n## Setting up the experiment\r\n\r\nWith this experiment, we use the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool to identify:\r\n\r\n* How many people are searching for "emoji-cupcake delivery"\r\n* What countries/regions/states/cities is that search is most common\r\n* Is there competition for this business idea\r\n\r\nTo get started, define the keywords that you think are important to this search. Some suggestions: *emoji-cupcake, emoji-cookie, emoji-cupcake delivery, cupcake delivery*. Once you have those, check out how they fair using the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool.\r\n\r\n## Analyzing the results\r\n\r\nAfter you run the query, you will get results that contain your keywords and related search phrases. You can use this to draw some high-level conclusions.\r\n\r\n### Search Volume\r\n\r\nSearch volume will give you an idea of the level of interest for each search phrase. If nobody is using your search phrases or similar search phrases, then there probably isn't much demand for the idea. \r\n\r\nLike most of these early-stage experiments, you have to determine the success threshold. Do 10k searches per month make you feel like there is a market for what you are selling? 100k? 1 million? \r\n\r\n### Suggested Bid\r\n\r\nWe can hypothesize that if a suggested bid is high, then a person is willing to pay for that solution/product. The idea is that advertisers are willing to pay for these ads at this high price, so they must be worth to warrant the expense.\r\n\r\nCombine this with the search volume for more insight. A high volume and high suggested bid could mean that there is a lot of people searching for a solution, and a lot of people willing to pay for it.\r\n\r\n### Specificity\r\n\r\nThe number of words in the search phrase can also be insightful. Let's say you tested "chores". You will probably see a lot of search volume, but we don’t really know what the user was looking for. The user could have been looking for a list, perhaps a snack called "chores". We can't be too sure. However, if we make the search phrase more specific like “how to share chores with roommates”, we have a much better idea of what problem the user is trying to solve.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources\r\n\r\n<small>* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qtT9o--kQ</small>	Blog Post	#process, #experiment	0.9	post_17	2023-07-14 18:02:19.688595	2025-09-01 03:09:32.098846	2025-09-01 03:09:32.098846
98	Validation with Facebook Ads 	Before you start building the world’s most awesome app, it’s a good idea to find out if people want it. I know it’s hard to believe others might not love your idea, but unfortunately, not everybody likes the same stuff. If we find out others have interest, you can avoid wasting time and money building something nobody wants.\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ads experiment will give you a high-level understanding around the following:\r\n\r\n- if you have a strong unique value proposition\r\n- if people desire to learn more about your idea, and\r\n- which audience cares the most about it\r\n\r\n<mark>This experiment will not give you proof - this experiment will give you confidence.</mark> Wouldn't it be nice to have confidence that someone other than your best friend likes your idea?\r\n\r\n# The Experiment\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ads experiment leverages Facebook’s large and diverse user base and its rich data about those users. With this data, you can target specific audiences and uncover the level of interest in your idea.\r\n\r\nEach experiment will involve running 2 ads to A/B test against. Each ad has a design that highlights the unique value proposition and targets a specific audience. <mark>In each experiment, you isolate a variable to uncover which one garners interest. Those variables could be the unique value proposition, design, or audience.</mark>\r\n\r\n## Getting set up\r\n\r\nIn order to run this experiment you will need a few things:\r\n\r\n- An idea for an app.\r\n- At least one Unique Value Proposition (UVP) - it’s okay to have more than one.\r\n- A well-defined audience that will be using your app.\r\n- A Facebook account\r\n- _Optional but highly recommended: Facebook page *_\r\n- _Optional but highly recommended: Splash page **_\r\n\r\n<small>\r\n* If you want your ad to appear in the Facebooks users’ news feeds, you will need a Facebook page and a website. A simple Facebook page with an image and a single post saying coming soon will cover the page. A simple splash site stating your UVP and a "coming soon" will work.\r\n</small>\r\n\r\n<small>**If you do create the splash page, you could incorporate a currency exchange. This would allow people to pay or sign up to be on a waiting list. Here is an example of a somewhat in-depth splash page to test a currency exchange http://www.nillyapp.com/ </small>\r\n\r\n## Running the ads\r\n\r\nTo run the ads, visit https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads. You will need to log into your Facebook account to create the ads. I won’t go into great detail about how to do actually create the ads since the UI changes so often, but I will cover the main points. \r\n\r\n### Ad Type\r\n\r\nIdeally, you want an ad that is meant to generate leads. You could create an ad that drives people to a Facebook page, but you wouldn’t benefit from the possible currency exchange of a splash page. Regardless of what type of ad you pick, make sure that you are charged per click. Clicks are a low-level form of validation.\r\n\r\n### Audience & Placements\r\n\r\nChose an audience that is narrow. A large vague audience makes it more difficult to determine who is interested in your idea. You have the option to run ads just on Facebook, on Instagram, or on their entire ad network. If you believe that one of those areas doesn’t apply to you, then feel free to cut it out. Just make sure that you are consistent with all the ads.\r\n\r\n### Budget & Schedule\r\n\r\nEach ad should run for at least 7 days. I tend to spend about $100 to start. It's really up to you.\r\n\r\n### Design & Content\r\n\r\nDesign and content encompass the format, media, page, and links. You will want to create a simple ad that shows your UVP and has a call to action. Here is an example ad:\r\n\r\n![Example Facebook Ad](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad%402x.png)\r\n\r\n## Taking action with each test\r\n\r\nFor the best results, you'll want to run at least 3 A/B tests. If the first 3 A/B tests return mixed results, you may want to run up to 6 A/B tests. I'll do my best to guide you from where to start and then based off of your results, where to go next. \r\n\r\n## Determining success\r\n\r\nBare in mind that these A/B test will return a single data point for you to compare results - clicks per impressions. You have to determine what success looks like. Different ideas should have different thresholds.\r\nIf your idea is hard to execute and you need many users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be very high. If your idea is easy to execute and needs a few users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be low.\r\n\r\nTry to answer these questions to determine a success threshold:\r\n\r\n- How difficult do you think it will be to execute on your idea?\r\n- How many users do you think you will need to be successful?\r\n- How much competition is there for your idea?\r\n- What is the average lifetime value of a customer?\r\n- What is the average cost for this kind of product?\r\n- What is the size of your audience?\r\n\r\n## Things to avoid\r\n\r\nAvoid the desire to get clicks! Keep in mind that just getting clicks isn’t going to teach you anything - you need to know why you got the clicks. This is not about advertising best practices. You can throw words like “free” and “limited time” that will encourage clicks, but we don’t want that. <mark>We want an ad that tests only the value of your idea and the audiences that see it.</mark>\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable outcomes is to identify that your idea doesn’t resonate with anybody.  You save all the time and money it takes to build something nobody needs.\r\n\r\n# Experiments\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with style variable\r\n\r\nThis test will help you identify if your unique value proposition garners interest from a particular audience. You can run a single ad by itself, but I prefer to run 2 ads with the same content but different styles. This helps create a variable and a control to use for comparison. \r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n![value proposition with style variable example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad-comparison%402x.png)\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- same audience (control)\r\n- same unique value proposition (control)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- different aesthetic style (variable)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\n<mark>If both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that enough people like your idea, then you've got some validation.</mark> You can stop experimenting if you'd like, or if you want to be more thorough, you can move on to the second test: testing the audience.\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks per impressions than the other, you could be concerned that the unique value proposition isn’t strong enough and that the ads visual style is what garnered the clicks. You should run a UVP A/B test to isolate the style as the enticing factor.\r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks to make you happy, you should run this test again with a different UVP.\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with value proposition variable\r\n\r\nThis test is to help us identify the interest of our unique value proposition. Unlike the solo UPV a/b test, here we are going to pit two UVPs against each other. This test is great to run when you have competing ideas, or when you are not sure which aspect of your idea people are most interested in.\r\n\r\nWhen creating this ad, make sure that the ad is simple and focuses mostly on the unique value proposition.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n![Value proposition with value proposition variable example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad-uvp-comparison%402x.png)\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- same audience (control)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- same aesthetic style (control)\r\n- different unique value propositions (variable)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it.\r\n\r\nIf both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you might want to do two things: one - run a solo UPV test with each UVP to see if the style was the draw, or two - pick the UVP that is coupled with the least risky to execute business plan. \r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try three things: pick two completely different UVPs and run this again, try a different UVP and run the solo UVP tests, run this test again with a different audience.\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with audience variable\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this experiment is to determine which audience responds best to the UVP. This experiment is best if you think your UVP is great, but the audiences you have tested thus far, are the wrong audiences. \r\n\r\nThis test should be run only after you have run either the value proposition with style variable or the value proposition with value proposition variable experiment. </mark> You will use the same value proposition and style for both ads, but now you’ll run them on two different audiences. \r\n\r\nIt might seem that you could run only one ad this time, and compare results to the previous experiment, but we would then be creating an experiment with two variables: audience and dates the ad ran. <mark>It is important to note that dates can affect click through rates - holidays, times of the year, days of the week, can all affect click rate. </mark> It is best to have only one variable, so you should run two ads for the most accurate results.\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- different audiences, one should be the same as a previous experiment (variable)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- same aesthetic style from the previous experiment (control)\r\n- same unique value propositions from the previous experiment (control)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it.\r\n\r\nIf both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you should be good to go. You know that more than one audience resonates with your value proposition.\r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try two things: pick a completely different UVP and run this again or pick a different UVP and run the UVP test.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ad experiment is a great place to start to build confidence that your idea is resonating with a larger group of people. It is by no means perfect, but it is a good tool for de-risking your product idea up front. Remember, the biggest resource you have is your own time. Be sure to take steps up front to understand if your product can be successful. \r\n\r\n\r\n	Blog Post	#framework, #lean, #experiment	0.9	post_16	2023-07-14 18:02:28.613096	2025-09-01 03:09:32.104167	2025-09-01 03:09:32.104167
99	Kill, Pivot or Preserve	==Running out of money or time can force a product team into making difficult decisions about the future of their product. The two most challenging decisions: [pivot](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/ways-to-pivot-a-product) the product or kill it altogether.== To be presented with a challenging decision like this isn't rare; it might happen many times during the life of a product.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest stages of a product, when the risk of running out of resources is greatest, it's important to be very critical of your path and ask yourself if you should kill, pivot or persevere every couple weeks. Typically, the first time you encounter this question, you will rely on the qualitative data from customer development. As your product grows, and you have more users, you can rely on both qualitative and quantitative data such as [pirate metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version).\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to always preserve, but it isn't always the best decision. ==A product is most successful when it can be looked at critically, and changes are made based on what has been learned.== Taking the time to think about the successes and failures of your product and your limited resources, will keep you thinking about your customer and priority.\r\n\r\n## When to Kill\r\n\r\nThe hardest decisions to make about your product is to kill it. I would love to say that a product should be killed when the team has tried everything without success, but that isn't the case. Resources will run out before you can try everything. ==If you can save your resources for a project that has more promise, you probably should.==\r\n\r\nA few questions you can ask yourself before you decide to kill the project:\r\n\r\n* Do you have a continued passion for your product or vision?\r\n* Can you identify exactly why your product is failing?\r\n* Will more than 50% of your customers be "very disappointed" if you kill your product?\r\n* Are there seeing signs of success in the future?\r\n* Are there obvious pivot options that you haven't tried?\r\n* Do you have enough runway (time, money, resources) to try a pivot?\r\n* Will you be devastated if you kill your product?\r\n\r\nIf you answered **no** to more than one of those questions, this product may be ready for the shelf. But obviously, even if you did answer all of those questions with a no, you might be able to justify continuing on. Don't let a stinkin' blog post sink your ship ;) \r\n\r\n## When to Pivot\r\n\r\nThere are many types of pivots that you can make if your product isn't succeeding. Assuming that you are not feeling enough success to continue on the same path, here are some questions you can ask yourself before deciding to pivot:\r\n\r\n* Are there particular parts of your product that are being used far more than others?\r\n* Are customers complaining that your product is too specific?\r\n* Is there a particular customer segment that has responded better than others?\r\n* Are there new channels to your customers that you haven't tried?\r\n* Have you tried changing the pricing? The way you are selling your product? I.e. subscription, a la carte, etc?\r\n* Have you tried focusing on different growth model? Paid, viral, referral etc?\r\n\r\n## When to Preserve \r\n\r\nIt is easy to choose to preserve, but it isn't always the right answer. Before you decide that you don't need to make any major changes to your products path, try asking yourself a few questions:\r\n\r\n* Do you still have a passion for the vision of the product?\r\n* Is the product currently meeting your goals?\r\n* Is the product sustainable at this pace?\r\n* If the product continues at this pace, will it exceed your goals?\r\n* Do you have to defend the product to anyone on your team? \r\n* Do you feel like you have put too much into the product to give up?[IKEA effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect)\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Decision Meeting\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of a product, I like to run a kill, pivot or preserve meeting every 2 weeks. This is when the product is at the greatest risk of running out of money, time or resources. The meeting generally involves the presenter, the stakeholders and anyone that can help to answer questions about the data in the presentation. ==The presenter, often the founder, presents a quick summary of the last 2 weeks, then makes a recommendation to the stakeholders to kill, pivot or preserve. The stakeholders often ask questions, and then vote for or against the recommendation.== Often, you get a consensus, but if that isn't possible, you follow the majority vote or the stakeholder with the largest stake.\r\n\r\n### The Agenda\r\n\r\n* Review the vision of the product.\r\n* Review the goals for the last 2 weeks.\r\n* Talk about what was achieved, and what was learned.\r\n* Present the decision about what to do next, and how the learnings have informed this decision and what steps you will take.\r\n* Vote on it.\r\n\r\n### The Presentation\r\n\r\nI usually create the presentation the day before or day of the meeting. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes to create. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be clear and consistent. It is a great tool to look back and see what you have tried and what you have learned.\r\n\r\nThe presentations can be difficult to compile. When I sit down to start creating the presentation, I often think to myself "what did we do the last 2 weeks?" ==As I begin to prepare the presentation I am almost always wowed by what we have learned and accomplished.== My presentations are anywhere from 5 - 10 pages, and take about 10 minutes to present.  A decision meeting presentation might include:\r\n\r\n* Reminder of the vision of our product.\r\n* Brief summary of what was accomplished in the last 2 weeks.\r\n* Overview of the [meaningful metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version) if you are far enough along.\r\n* Successes and failures, and what we learned from them.\r\n* List of assumptions that have been tested, and if they were validated or invalidated.\r\n* Brief summary of the budget, burn and runway.\r\n* The decision to kill, pivot or preserve.\r\n* A rough plan for the next 2 weeks\r\n\r\nA decision meeting can provide a lot of value. You are setting a tone of transparency. Sharing exciting findings and demonstrating progress. Uncovering new learnings and explaining the direction of the product. Celebrating successes, and illuminating failures as an opportunity to learn. ==Finally, you are keeping the team and stakeholders in the loop and vested and interested in the product.==	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experiment	0.9	post_14	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	2025-09-01 03:09:32.110694	2025-09-01 03:09:32.110694
100	Running a Lean Experiment	If you are building an app with limited time and money, experiments are a necessity. ==It is invaluable to learn what works, and what doesn't, before you invest time and money into an idea.==\r\n\r\nIt's true that some people get it correct the first time. But, that is  rare and risky to assume that you got it correct too. Running experiments helps you gain confidence that you are creating a _correct_ solution.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I will outline the components of a Lean experiment. ==I use Lean experiments because they emphasize spending the least amount of time to build a testable solution.==\r\n\r\n## Setting Up a Lean Experiment\r\n\r\nA Lean experiment follows a straightforward path: \r\n\r\n* Establish your riskiest assumption\r\n* Identify the customer behavior associated with that assumption\r\n* Commit to a single metric you believe in\r\n* Design a solution\r\n* Capture your hypothesis\r\n* Build the minimum viable feature/product\r\n* Document the results\r\n* Record your observations\r\n* Add your insights\r\n\r\nLet's go more into detail about each part of a Lean experiment.\r\n\r\n### [Identify the Riskiest Assumption](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-assumption)\r\n\r\nThe riskiest assumption is an assumption you are making about a key-stone element of your product. You accept it as true without evidence. ==It can take form as a belief about your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about market size, and many other things.==  It is best to start with the riskiest assumptions first.  If we don't address this assumption, this business idea might fail. \r\n\r\nThe riskiest assumption is not easy to find [1]. When trying to find your riskiest assumption, start with universal risks. Be sure to use your intuition and challenge your own assumptions. Follow up by talking with domain experts.\r\n\r\n### [The Customer's Action](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-action)\r\n\r\nHow does your riskiest assumption relate to your customer’s actions? \r\n\r\nLet’s pretend that your riskiest assumption is "customers will trust your service with their personal information". The related **action** is the customer giving you their personal information. \r\n\r\nWhen creating a Lean experiment, you want to identify an action that you can test and measure. Some examples:\r\n\r\n* Choses option a over b\r\n* Pays you for the product\r\n* Signs up for a newsletter\r\n* Comes back to the application the next day\r\n* Refers a friend\r\n\r\nThe best types of actions are real “currency” exchanges. This is when a person give you something of value to them. It demonstrates a high level of honesty in their action. ==The more currency that the person has to spend to complete this action, the more value we can associate with that action.==\r\n\r\n### Target Metric\r\n\r\nCommit to a minimum success threshold. Choose a number high enough to get you and your team excited if true and relative to the assumption you are testing.\r\n\r\n### Experiment\r\n\r\nBuild the absolute minimum required to test your assumption, as fast as possible. Don’t just confirm, learn. Include ways to capture surprises as well as real behavior important to validating your business activity is successful in influencing customer behavior.\r\n\r\n### [Hypothesis](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-hypothesis)\r\n\r\nA specific description of the customer behavior you’re measuring, your target metric and the experiment you’re running to test your assumption. If we do X, then Y% of customers will behave in way Z.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened? Record the actual metrics generated during your experiment, paying close attention to new behaviors and surprises. For example, 50% (5/10) people behaved in way Z.\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n\r\nWhy did the customer behave this way? Record the observable behavior, live feedback and reactions you witnessed firsthand, which influenced the actual results.\r\n\r\n### Insights\r\n\r\nInsights change the way you think about your customers or your idea. Record the new information you generated during this experiment, as well as unique observations made in the field.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nWas your riskiest assumption true? Look for a trend in your evidence over time. No single experiment holds all the answers. Iterate? Persevere? Pivot? \r\n\r\nIf you are running many experiments it can be a good idea to create a visual map of those experiments so your team can be aware of the progress you are making [2].\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nRemember, there is no perfect solution, but there are certainly ones that are better than others. Don't assume that you got it right. Assume that you don't know, but the people using your application will tell and show you what "right" feels like. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Endnotes\r\n\r\n- [1] https://leanstack.com/on-identifying-riskiest-assumptions/\r\n- [2] http://www.movestheneedle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rapid_Experiment_Map.pdf	Blog Post	#framework, #lean, #experiment	0.9	post_13	2023-07-14 18:02:53.805307	2025-09-01 03:09:32.116572	2025-09-01 03:09:32.116572
101	Better Meetings	Meeting fatigue is a common issue in this Virtual First world we work in. There are loads of reasons that video meetings feel taxing. What stood out to me is the actual effect that back-to-back video meetings has on your brain. Some recent research done by [Zoom and Microsoft brought to light that back-to- back video meetings has a negative effect on the brain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2021/04/20/our-brains-need-breaks-from-virtual-meetings/?sh=4b7d38fd21e9). After about 60 minutes of constant video chatting, the brain starts to react as if it’s under stress. \r\n \r\n## Solution\r\nAccording to the research, taking 10 minute breaks between Zoom meetings has the very positive result of keeping your brain out of the stress zone. We’ve known breaks are good, but it’s not always easy to take them. My plan is simple — create a meeting culture that prioritizes breaks.\r\n\r\n## Principles\r\n### Start meetings late. \r\nWhen we end meetings early it’s easy to run over time. However people rarely show up early if you start them late.\r\n\r\n### Meetings should be short. \r\nIf you have 30 minutes, you’ll take 30 minutes. By constraining the duration of the meeting, you can improve the focus. You can have more productive meetings, enforce agendas, and demand decisions.\r\n\r\n## Executing\r\nIf you create a meeting using the principles above, the result should be: \r\n\r\n- 20 minute meetings start at :10 or :40 after.\r\n- 40 minute meetings start at :20 after.\r\n- No 30 or 60 minute meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Wrap-Up\r\nMeeting fatigue is a real issue in today's virtual work environment. Back-to-back video meetings have been found to have a negative effect on the brain, causing stress and burnout. However, by taking 10-minute breaks between meetings, we can keep our brains out of the stress zone and increase productivity. \r\n\r\nTo create a meeting culture that prioritizes breaks, <b>start meetings late and keep them short.</b>. By doing so, you can focus on the quality of the meeting and more easily enforce agendas and decisions. We can have more productive and efficient meetings while reducing meeting fatigue and improving our overall work performance.

102	Flow & Design Elements	Simply put, "flow" is a highly focused mental state.  It is a level of engagement so concentrated, you don't realize that time has passed until you are out of your flow state. Mikhaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who coined the term, writes about "flow" in his book _Flow_ - first published in 1990. \r\n\r\nCsikszentmihalyi outlines the qualifications a flow state, and the conditions needed to create one. While I was reading it, it dawned on me how many conditions of flow are baked-in to good design. I am writing a more in depth post about designing for flow, but in the meantime, this post lists the qualifications and conditions of flow to consider when designing.\r\n\r\n## Qualifications\r\n\r\nTo experience flow, means you experience:\r\n\r\n*  Intense and focused concentration on the present moment\r\n* Merging of action and awareness\r\n* A loss of reflective self-consciousness\r\n* A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity\r\n* A distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered\r\n* The activity as intrinsically rewarding\r\n\r\n## Conditions\r\n\r\nTo create a flow state, we want to look at the conditions of flow:\r\n\r\n* High perceived challenges\r\n* High perceived skills\r\n* Knowing what to do\r\n* Knowing how to do it\r\n* Knowing how well you are doing\r\n* Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved)\r\n* Freedom from distractions\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nOwen Schaffer, a user researcher and so much more, came up with a questionnaire we can use to understand if the person using our application is in a flow state:\r\n\r\n#### How much of the time did you know?\r\n\r\n|  | Never | Half the time | Always |\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n| What to do next |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| How to do what you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| How well you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| Where to go next |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n\r\n#### How much did you feel?\r\n\r\n|  | Not at all | Somewhat | Very much |\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n| How challenging did this activity feel |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| You could overcome the challenges you faced |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| You were distracted from what you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n\r\n#### Scoring\r\n\r\nReverse the score of the last question to get Freedom from Distractions. The items above are in the following order: Clear What to Do, Clear How to Do it, Clear How Well Doing, Clear Where to Go, Challenge, Skill, and Freedom from Distractions.\r\n\r\n## Moving On\r\n\r\nThe next time you are thinking about designing a user experience, try to think about the qualifications and conditions of flow. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### References:\r\n\r\n- [Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491137281&sr=8-1&keywords=flow)\r\n- [Crafting Fun Experiences: A Method to Facilitate Flow](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/courses/imgd5100/papers/FlowQuestionnaire.pdf)\r\n- [Flow Questionnaire](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/courses/imgd5100/papers/FlowQuestionnaire.pdf#19)\r\n- [The 8 Elements of Flow](http://www.flowskills.com/the-8-elements-of-flow.html)\r\n	Blog Post	#ux, #psychology	0.9	post_11	2023-05-31 17:32:34.706013	2025-09-01 03:09:32.128369	2025-09-01 03:09:32.128369
103	Fixed Position Bug on iOS	The `fixed` value for the `position` property has a very noticeable glitch in\r\niOS9 and perhaps many other versions. ==When scrolling vertically the\r\n`fixed` elements can take a different position than intended.== A fixed header\r\ncould settle 5 to 10 pixels from the top, or a footer might get cut off.\r\n\r\nWe can fix it by establishing the height and width of the `body` and\r\n`html` and setting the `overflow` to auto and\r\n`webkit-overflow-scrolling` to touch.\r\n\r\n## Fix:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\nbody,\r\nhtml {\r\n  height: 100vh;\r\n  overflow: auto;\r\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\r\n  width: 100vw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n==This prevents the browser's menubar from retracting which allows for the fixed\r\nelements to take their intended position.== It does improve the\r\nscrolling experience, but it also leaves us with an omnipresent menubar.\r\n	Blog Post	#code, #ui	0.9	post_1	2023-07-14 18:05:30.524089	2025-09-01 03:09:32.133336	2025-09-01 03:09:32.133336
104	Manager or Individual Contributor 	Are you questioning which track to take as a Product Designer - Manager or Individual Contributor (IC)? Are you managing someone who is questioning which track to take? Throughout my career, I've had to make this decision personally, as well as work with colleagues that were making this decision. I've tried to support mentees, reports, and colleagues, and let me tell you, the context surrounding the decision is never the same twice. \r\n\r\nIn an [ADP List](https://adplist.org) mentee session, I was asked for some support with the following situation:\r\n\r\n> [...] I've been working as both a product designer and a design manager. However, the scope of the product I'm working on is too big, and I can't work effectively with my team. As a result, I've had to cancel my 1:1 meetings with my direct reports and can't help them when they need my assistance. This situation is frustrating for me.\r\nI recently discussed this with my manager, and they asked me what my choice would be if the company gave me the opportunity to continue working as a design manager/lead or as an individual contributor/product designer.\r\n\r\nMy goal with in that meeting, and with this post is to provide, two significant pieces of information that might help with thinking through this topic. \r\n\r\n# Do Consider\r\n#### Are you comfortable making decisions that directly affect people's lives?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe role of a manager varies, but one thing is clear: your decisions directly impact people's lives. You decide which projects they'll work on, their salary, and even their employment status.\r\n\r\nOf course being a manager has its joys: helping people develop new skills, setting them up for success, and creating opportunities are just part of the fun. However, being a manager also means making tough decisions and giving feedback.\r\n\r\nA good manager is emotionally available, able to handle difficult situations, resolve conflicts, and address issues face-to-face. If you're uncomfortable telling someone they're not performing well, reassigning them from a beloved project, or in the extreme letting them go, then being a manager may not be for you.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't want to focus solely on the challenges, it's important to recognize that you can't be a good manager if you're not willing to make decisions that directly affect people's lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Do Not Consider\r\n#### Do you love using your technical skills?\r\n\r\nMany people claim that as a manager, you no longer need to use your technical design skills. However, it's not about using the same skills, but rather leveraging your expertise and applying your technical abilities to new areas of responsibility. Don't think of switching tracks as a waste of your acquired skills. If someone tells you that you're wasting your skills, they're only looking at the outcomes you've delivered, not considering your true potential.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if you feel that you lack the technical skills to progress in your current track, take a moment to reflect. Are you experiencing imposter syndrome, lacking motivation, or simply not ready to invest in your career? It's alright if you're not prepared to develop new skills in your current path. \r\n\r\nHowever, if that's the case, now may not be the right time to explore a new track. First, ensure that you understand what is inhibiting your desire to invest in yourself. Simply changing tracks isn't always reliable inspiration. In fact, it can often backfire and further hinder progress, as immediate wins may become even more scarce.\r\n\r\n# Closing\r\nwhether you're deciding between a Manager or Individual Contributor (IC) track or supporting someone in this decision, consider the unique context of each situation. But two things to remember; 1) if you don't want to make decisions that affect people lives directly, don't be a manager, and 2) if you're worried about wasting your technical skills, don't be.\r\n\r\n# 👍\r\n	Blog Post	#management	0.9	post_27	2023-07-13 02:12:33.50214	2025-09-01 03:09:32.138967	2025-09-01 03:09:32.138967
105	Syntax Highlighting Markdown in Rails	This post is to help you add syntax highlighting to your markdown in a rails app. I prefer to use [Redcarpet] for markdown processing, and [Rouge] for syntax highlighting. This is a complete ruby solution, I believe its the\r\n[fastest], and somewhat easy to implement.\r\n\r\n## 1. Add the redcarpet Gem\r\nAdd the `redcarpet` gem.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Gemfile\r\n\r\ngem "redcarpet"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Create MarkdownParser Class\r\nCreate a `MarkdownParser` class to handle parsing our markdown.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/markdown_parser.rb\r\n\r\nclass MarkdownParser\r\n  require "redcarpet"\r\n\r\n  def initialize(markdown)\r\n    @markdown = markdown\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def markdown_to_html\r\n    processor.render(@markdown).html_safe\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def processor\r\n    Redcarpet::Markdown.new(renderer, extensions = {})\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def renderer\r\n    Redcarpet::Render::HTML\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Add the rouge-rails Gem\r\nAdd the `rouge-rails` gem.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Gemfile\r\n\r\ngem "rouge-rails"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Create a RougeRenderer Class\r\nCreate a `RougeRenderer` class to handle syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/rouge_renderer.rb\r\n\r\nclass RougeRenderer < Redcarpet::Render::HTML\r\n  require "rouge"\r\n  require "rouge/plugins/redcarpet"\r\n\r\n  include Rouge::Plugins::Redcarpet\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Use RougeRenderer to Render\r\nUse the `RougeRenderer` class as the Redcarpet markdown renderer.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/markdown_parser.rb\r\n\r\nclass MarkdownParser\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  def renderer\r\n    RougeRenderer.new(render_options = {})\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6. Set Stylesheets\r\nThere are a couple of ways to add the code styles to you rails app. I like to use the rouge `rougify` CLI command to generate a stylesheet.  The CLI command should let you generate any theme found in the rouge gem's [themes](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/tree/master/lib/rouge/themes).\r\n\r\nFor example, to generate a github stylesheet:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ rougify style github > app/assets/stylesheets/github.css\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add it to your `application.scss` file.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss\r\n\r\n@import "github";\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also copy a stylesheet from [here](https://github.com/jacobsimeon/rouge-rails/tree/master/app/assets/stylesheets/rouge), but be aware of how the classes are scoped. You will have to set up Rogue to handle themes.\r\n\r\n## 7. Use It\r\nYou can pass the markdown parser a file:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n# app/views/some_view.html.erb\r\n\r\n<% file = File.read("path/to/file.md") %>\r\n<%= MarkdownParser.new(file).markdown_to_html %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can directly pass text to the markdown parser:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n# app/views/some_view.html.erb\r\n\r\n<%= MarkdownParser.new("#heading ```code {} ```").markdown_to_html %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Resources:\r\n- [Redcarpet Gem](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet)\r\n- [Rouge Rails Gem](https://github.com/jacobsimeon/rouge-rails)\r\n- [Markdown Processing in Ruby, by Jesse Herrick](https://www.sitepoint.com/markdown-processing-ruby/)\r\n- [Code Stylesheets from @jacobsimeon](https://github.com/jacobsimeon/rouge-rails/tree/master/app/assets/stylesheets/rouge)	Blog Post	#code	0.9	post_2	2023-07-12 17:59:02.152501	2025-09-01 03:09:32.144992	2025-09-01 03:09:32.144992
106	Ways To Pivot A Product	If you've hit a point in your product when progress or growth has halted and the current path forward is no longer working, perhaps it's time for a pivot. As Eric Reis put it "a pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision."\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of pivots. Some, such as a marketing pivot or channel pivot, don't involve changing your product. Others can be as drastic as stripping away all the things that aren't working, and zooming-in on only the most important feature. Here is a short list of some different pivots to get your brain flowing:\r\n\r\n><mark>A pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision.</mark>\r\n\r\n><small>Eric Reis</small>\r\n\r\n# Customer need pivot\r\n\r\nIn some cases, early on your customers might show little interest in the problem you are solving. This pivot is about rethinking the value of the problem you are solving. Perhaps it's time to solve a different problem with a completely new product. \r\n\r\nOne of the most popular customer need pivots is Groupon. You've probably never heard of the website "The Point": a social good fundraising site that employed the _tipping point system_ to secure funding. When enough people promised a pledge, the funding would be secured - kind of like Kickstarter. It didn't catch on. The founder decided to pivot to a different customer need using the same concept of the _tipping point_. The Point became Groupon. A site where groups of people could hit a tipping point that would open up coupons for use. \r\n\r\n# Zoom-in pivot\r\n\r\nDo you have at least one great feature? Take only the most successful feature (most used? highest grossing?) and strip away anything that isn't necessary for the success of that feature. Double-down on what has been working well, rather than trying to expand into new areas.\r\n\r\nNokia began as a paper mill in 1865. As the company grew, they expanded what they produced, including rubber goods, electronics, and telecommunications devices. In 1992, they zoomed-in and decided to focus exclusively on their mobile devices. They sold off all other divisions of their company and rose to great success (albeit unmaintainable...) \r\n\r\n# Zoom-out pivot\r\n\r\nIf you have an extremely focused product and simple feature set, perhaps it's time to think about expanding into new areas and solving other problems. Dig into your customer and see if they are using your product as a compliment to other software or tools. If so, think about solving for some of the problems that those other tools solve.\r\n\r\nA great example of the zoom-out pivot is PayPal. PayPal started specifically to allow people to beam payments over handheld PDAs. It took a lot of permutations, and the merger with a financial services company, before PayPal became a payments platform. Quickly thereafter, they became the preferred online payment system for eBay and rose to glory.\r\n\r\n# Customer segment pivot\r\n\r\nPerhaps your product solves an actual problem, but the customers who you've been targeting don't appreciate it the way you'd hoped they would. Was there another audience that hinted at the value of your product, but it wasn't for them? Perhaps now is a good time to try and position and optimize your product for a more appreciative segment.\r\n\r\n# Business model pivot\r\n\r\nYour product may not be the problem. Perhaps your pricing model and monetization strategy are inhibiting your product from being more successful. A business model pivot is about altering your pricing model, monetization strategy, and marketing strategy to capture the most value. \r\n\r\nHave fun pivoting ;)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonnazar/2013/10/08/14-famous-business-pivots/#4631e34e5797\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC_IG-EZQUY\r\n- http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\r\n- http://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4\r\n- https://www.fastcompany.com/3001984/pinterest-pivot	Blog Post	#framework, #lean, #experiment	0.9	post_21	2023-07-12 18:50:22.978948	2025-09-01 03:09:32.150482	2025-09-01 03:09:32.150482
107	The IKEA Effect	As a Designer and Product Consultant, one of the most common traits I see in product teams is an unwillingness to throw away the things they've made. Some of the teams I've worked with celebrate removing lines of code, but ==more often then not, people believe that what they made is too valuable to throw away== (even if it can be brought back using Github, [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) or the myriad other forms of version control.)\r\n\r\nThe feeling of sunk costs comes in many forms: you might care what others think of you or that you'll regret quitting because you might be on to something. What I encounter most often is a team that feels their work is too valuable to toss. ==This is known as the IKEA effect: labor equals valuation.==\r\n\r\nThe IKEA effect was coined by Michael I. Norton a, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely after conducting a study on how labor affects valuation. They captured their findings in the paper [The IKEA Effect: When Labor Meets Love](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20mochon%20ariely.pdf). \r\n\r\nThe researchers set up four studies in which they had the participants assemble IKEA boxes, fold origami, and put together sets of Legos. The researchers found that participants viewed their amateur creations to have equal value to that of an expert's creation. Moreover, they expected others would feel the same. \r\n\r\n> <mark>Participants saw their amateurish creations as similar in value to experts' creations and expected others to share their opinions.</mark>\r\n\r\n> <small>Michael I.Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely</small>\r\n\r\nHowever, if the participants were asked to destroy their creation as part of the task, or failed to complete the assembly, the feeling of value was gone. The conclusion was that labor leads to love when labor results in successful completion of tasks, and that labor increases valuation for both “do-it-yourselfers” and novices.\r\n\r\nIf you're ever on the fence about tossing a feature or throwing out some code, ask yourself if you see value in it because you built it. Don't let sunk costs sink you (sorry for that closing bit).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Sources:\r\n\r\n- http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740811000829	Blog Post	#ux, #psychology	0.9	post_20	2023-07-14 17:59:10.539672	2025-09-01 03:09:32.156753	2025-09-01 03:09:32.156753
108	Styling a Rails App in the Browser	As much as I love Sketh, Figma and other tools for creating interfaces, sometime designing in the browser is best. Once I have established a general layout, I like to use the browser for tweaking styles and component placement. \r\n\r\nI have no hard-and-fast rule about when to make the transition from a design tool to the browser, other than when I feel like I am making a lot of minor adjustments to my design file. At that point, it usually means that I am generally happy with the design and it's time to get a little more nitty gritty and try things out. This is also great when you aren't starting a design from scratch, rather iteration to optimize, or perhaps adding a new feature. \r\n\r\nThe most cumbersome thing about designing in the browser is the tools that are available to work with. You either write the CSS locally and refresh the browser, or fidget with the browser tools to see what you like then copy that over to your CSS. \r\n\r\nHowever, with [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) you can write CSS as you normally would; in your text editor. When you save the file, the browser reflects the changes you made without you having to refresh the page. \r\n\r\n## Installing the gem\r\n\r\nWe only want Guard to be operating in our development environment. We will use:\r\n\r\n- [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)\r\n- [Guard Livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#Gemfile\r\n\r\ngroup :development do\r\n  [...]\r\n  gem "guard"\r\n  gem "guard-livereload", require: false\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall the gem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setting up Guard\r\n\r\nSetup guard by adding a Guard definition to our Guardfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ guard init livereload\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setting up the browser\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways to get Guard working in the browser; a browser extension, or middleware. I prefer using middleware, as it keeps all Guard related changes in the codebase.\r\n\r\nI use [rack-liverload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload). Again, we only want this when we are developing, so we scope it to our development environment. Let's set it up:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#Gemfile\r\n\r\ngroup :development do\r\n  [...]\r\n  gem "guard"\r\n  gem "guard-livereload", require: false\r\n  gem "rack-livereload"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure to install the gem, and then restart your server ;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, let's add the middleware to our Rails middleware stack:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#config/environments/development.rb\r\n\r\nMyApp::Application.configure do\r\n  # ...\r\n  config.middleware.insert_after ActionDispatch::Static, Rack::LiveReload\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using\r\n\r\nNow that you are ready to start designing in the browser, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle exec guard\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, Guard will watch all files from `/` on up. When you make an edit and save it, Guard will reload your browser with the new files. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n	Blog Post	#code	0.9	post_12	2023-07-14 18:03:35.401125	2025-09-01 03:09:32.167875	2025-09-01 03:09:32.167875
109	The Hypothesis	The guiding light to a good experiment is the hypothesis. It is the second\r\nstep to setting up an experiment, right after establishing your risky\r\nassumption.  ==If you can't articulate a hypothesis, then you don't\r\nhave an experiment.==\r\n\r\n==The most straightforward and clear way to write a hypothesis is the\r\n_if_ / _then_ format.== Let's break it down.\r\n\r\n## The "If"\r\n\r\n==The **if** is an isolated change in the application that will lead to\r\na desired behavior or outcome and should be coupled with your\r\nassumption.==  It can be as simple as better feedback, or as complex as\r\nadding a feature. I try to write these as solutions. From there, you should be\r\nable to infer the desire or needs of the user - or better yet, a problem they\r\nare facing.\r\n\r\nGood examples:\r\n\r\n* If we add a success message after...\r\n* If users can chat with one-another in the application...\r\n* If users can challenge one another...\r\n* If there is transparency in who is rating the products...\r\n\r\nBad examples:\r\n\r\n* If we add hundreds of new products...\r\n* If we make our app responsive and remove the landing page...\r\n\r\n## The "Then"\r\n\r\n==The **then** is focused on our desired behavior or outcome and\r\nshould be measurable.== Avoid desired outcomes that deal with\r\nemotion. Although you _could_ measure how happy a person is, it is generally\r\ndifficult to rely on.\r\n\r\nGood examples:\r\n\r\n* Then we will get more _sign ups_.\r\n* Then users will _share_ the app with each other.\r\n* Then more users will participate in the forum.\r\n\r\nBad examples:\r\n\r\n* Then the users will have more fun.\r\n* Then the users wont be so annoyed.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n==A well written hypothesis should help you understand from a high level how you\r\nare going to add value to the user, and how adding that value is going to\r\nresult in a desired and measurable outcome.==\r\n	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experiment	0.9	post_5	2023-07-14 18:05:01.427101	2025-09-01 03:09:32.174082	2025-09-01 03:09:32.174082
110	The Assumption	==Identifying assumptions help you de-risk in your product by uncovering what\r\nmight make your product fail and addressing that first.==\r\n\r\n==An assumption is a statement you are making about your product that is\r\naccepted as true without evidence.== An assumption can take form as a belief\r\nabout your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about\r\nmarket size, and many other things.\r\n\r\nA lean experiment should start with the assumption. ==You will want to\r\nvalidate/invalidate the riskiest assumptions first - the ones that if are\r\ninvalidated, the product might suffer or fail.==\r\n\r\n<a id="questions"></a>\r\n## Prioritizing Assumptions\r\n\r\nPrioritizing assumptions isn't always easy. I find that rating some questions\r\nabout an assumption helps me identify the level of risk associated with it.\r\n==Assign a **2 (for Yes)** a **1 (for Maybe)** and a **0 (for No)**.== The\r\nhighest total is most likely your riskiest assumption.\r\n\r\n* ==Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid?==\r\n* ==Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this?==\r\n* ==Will solving this add immediate business value?==\r\n* ==Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck?==\r\n\r\n## Assumption Example One\r\n\r\nLet's pretend we have a product intended to reduce the energy usage in a\r\nbuilding by pitting tenants against each other in a competition. Our products\r\nallows tenants to see the energy usage of each apartment. The lowest energy\r\nconsumer gets bragging rights. Let's look at two assumptions and score them:\r\n\r\n**Tenants are willing to share their energy usage with their neighbors. [1]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **No / 0**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **No / 0**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **No / 0**\r\n\r\n**Competition will drive change to reduce energy consumption. [7]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **Yes / 2**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **Yes / 2**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **Yes / 2**\r\n\r\nKnowing that competition actually will drive change is by far the most important\r\nidea to validate before moving forward. Without this, we don't have a product.\r\n\r\n## Assumption Example Two\r\n\r\nLet's imagine we are at a later stage with the app where  people are using it,\r\nbut we aren't seeing a significant reduction in energy usage. Let's look at two\r\nassumptions and score them:\r\n\r\n**People don't know how to reduce their energy usage. [4]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **Yes / 2**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **No / 0**\r\n\r\n**People don't understand the metric we use to compare them. [2]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **No / 0**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **No / 0**\r\n\r\nThese two score closely. The main difference is the risk we run of not solving\r\nfor the first assumption. If people don't know how to reduce their energy usage,\r\nthen we can never hit our goal of energy reduction and our product fails.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n==Identifying assumptions help you de-risk in your product.== Its best to test\r\nthe riskiest assumptions first. Prioritizing assumptions is not always easy. I\r\nhave found the rating [these questions](#questions) about an assumption helpful,\r\nbut ==if you don't feel confident that the scoring is accurate enough, I urge\r\nyou to dig deeper until you have the confidence that you have identified the\r\nnext riskiest assumption.==\r\n	Blog Post	#process, #lean, #experiment	0.9	post_4	2023-07-14 18:05:17.118768	2025-09-01 03:09:32.180458	2025-09-01 03:09:32.180458

112	Intersession Engagement Strategy	# Intersession Engagement Strategy\n\n## The Challenge\n\nAt Grow Therapy, we identified intersession engagement as a critical strategic priority. The therapy experience couldn't just happen once a week in a one-hour session. To deliver better care, support providers, and demonstrate outcomes strong enough to maintain insurance contracts, we had to improve the quality of care that happened between sessions.\n\n## The Solution\n\n### Session Topics Feature\n\nWe designed a system that prompted clients to reflect on their therapy experience before sessions. Key features included:\n\n- **Guided Reflection**: Help clients who struggle with reflection\n- **AI Summarization**: Convert open reflections into actionable topics\n- **Dynamic Prompting**: Contextual timing based on client journey\n- **Provider Preparation**: Clear, concise summaries for therapists\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\nThe solution focused on helping people who don't know how to reflect, rather than just serving those who already had the habit. This required:\n\n- Expanding the problem space beyond simple note-taking\n- Using exploration frameworks to generate divergent ideas\n- Studying competitors and using AI tools for inspiration\n- Validating why reflection was difficult in the first place\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n### Innovation vs. Pragmatism\n\nWe championed audio-first reflection based on evidence from our Summit acquisition, but adapted when the CTO pushed back. This showed the importance of balancing innovation with organizational alignment.\n\n### Strategic Pivots\n\nThe feature moved between standalone and mobile app integration multiple times. Success required maintaining vision while adjusting execution strategy.\n\n### Impact Measurement\n\nThe initiative demonstrated that intersession engagement was not only possible but powerful, advancing care quality and supporting measurable outcomes.

113	Leadership Lessons from Product Design	# Leadership Lessons from Product Design\n\n## Key Principles\n\n### 1. Coach, Don't Dictate\n\nThe best design leaders don't just give orders. They coach their teams to think bigger, explore more options, and develop their own problem-solving skills.\n\n### 2. Set Strategic Direction\n\nWhile coaching execution, leaders must set clear strategic direction. This means aligning with company goals and ensuring the team understands the "why" behind their work.\n\n### 3. Balance Innovation with Pragmatism\n\nChampion bold ideas, but know when to adapt and align with organizational decisions. This shows both vision and maturity.\n\n## Team Development\n\n### Building Strong Teams\n\n- Pull in the right people for specific challenges\n- Create opportunities for growth and learning\n- Foster collaboration between designers and product managers\n\n### Coaching Techniques\n\n- Use frameworks to push teams beyond obvious solutions\n- Encourage exploration of multiple approaches\n- Help teams reframe problems to be more ambitious\n\n## Strategic Alignment\n\n### Executive Communication\n\n- Present evidence-backed innovation proposals\n- Position design work as strategic differentiators\n- Secure alignment before major initiatives\n\n### Navigating Change\n\n- Guide teams through strategic pivots\n- Maintain vision while adjusting execution\n- Ensure continuity during organizational changes	Blog Post	#leadership, #management, #teambuilding, #coaching	0.9	post_33	2025-09-01 02:59:11.750222	2025-09-01 03:09:32.197641	2025-09-01 03:09:32.197641
114	Product Design Principles	# Product Design Principles\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Outcomes Over Output\n\nFocus on the end result rather than just the work produced. Measure success by impact, not effort.\n\n### 2. User-Centered Design\n\nAlways start with user needs and work backwards. Validate assumptions through research and testing.\n\n### 3. Iterative Development\n\nBuild, test, learn, repeat. Don't try to get it perfect the first time.\n\n## Design Process\n\n### Research Phase\n\n- Understand the problem space\n- Identify user pain points\n- Gather qualitative and quantitative data\n\n### Ideation Phase\n\n- Generate multiple solutions\n- Don't fall in love with the first idea\n- Use frameworks to push beyond obvious solutions\n\n### Validation Phase\n\n- Test with real users\n- Measure outcomes, not just satisfaction\n- Be willing to pivot based on evidence\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nDesign is not just about making things look good. It's about solving real problems for real people in ways that create measurable business value.

In just one week, we built\n    and shipped a prototype, tested it with users in Japan and Indonesia, won an\n    award, and progressed towards securing funding and a patent.\n  \n\n  \n    Our Head of International Research, \n    \n    Jen DiZio,\n    conducted extensive research on global work habits and tools, drawing from\n    her experience at Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. We discovered that over\n    2.5 billion people worldwide use chat apps daily, with over 1 billion using\n    them for work. Interestingly, most users rely on consumer chat apps like\n    Line, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger, rather than dedicated work apps like\n    Slack or Teams.\n  \n\n  \n    We identified key pain points through user feedback and quantitative\n    studies, finding three features that were deemed "most important" by over\n    80% of respondents.\n  \n\n  \n    Top 3 Existing Needs\n  \n\n  \n    \n      Storing files across multiple conversations.\n    \n    \n      Searching for files across multiple conversations.\n    \n    \n      Storing comments and decisions across multiple conversations.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    After a significant competitive audit, we recognized that no one was\n    directly addressing these customers' needs while meeting them where they\n    are. Consumer apps like Line prioritized personal conversations, while work\n    apps like Slack avoided the personal aspect. Both aimed to pull users away\n    from consumer chat apps into their own apps. However, SMBs and freelancers\n    outside the US, prefered to keep work and personal communication integrated,\n    leading to the use of multiple chat apps simultaneously.

This mindset expanded to other ideas,\n    focusing on supporting customers within their existing workflows. We pitched\n    a series of fast-follow concepts, leveraging browser extensions, app\n    integrations, and methods like email to Dropbox, avoiding the need for a new\n    app.\n  \n\n  \n    The prototype, validation, and pitch secured 6 months of funding from\n    Dropbox's internal incubator, Dynamo, for a team of 4 members. We assembled\n    a cross-functional team to drive the project towards its first milestone.\n  \n\n  \n    As a result of our work, we successfully applied for and were granted a\n    patent. The legal team at Dropbox supported us in filing for a patent for\n    our cloud-based storage solution bridging a chat application. We received\n    the patent in 2020.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    The Challenges\n  \n\n  \n    Within 3 weeks of securing funding, I went on paternity leave and the lead\n    Product Manager, EJ, left Dropbox. As a result, the project lacked inspired\n    leadership and expertise to drive it forward. We attempted to establish a\n    contingency plan, but it became evident that the necessary skill level was\n    not readily available within Dropbox. Consequently, the project funding was\n    redirected to a different project with a tangential value proposition, and\n    our project officially transitioned away from its original purpose.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Learnings\n  \n\n  \n    Our biggest failure was the lack of a solid plan for continued leadership.\n    Despite being aware of my upcoming leave and the Product Manager's\n    departure, we failed to adequately staff the project or identify alternative\n    leadership to ensure progress towards our first milestone. It was a valuable\n    lesson in the importance of proactive planning to maintain leadership and\n    momentum.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Closing\n  \n\n  \n    During Dropbox's 2019 summer hackweek, our team pursued an opportunity\n    identified by our Head of International Research. We built and shipped a\n    prototype, tested it with users in Japan and Indonesia, won an award, and\n    made progress towards funding and a patent. Our project aimed to address key\n    pain points in chat app usage for work, bridging the gap between consumer\n    and dedicated work apps.\n  \n\n  \n    The impact of our work was evident as we secured funding from Dropbox's\n    internal incubator and successfully applied for a patent. Our project\n    contributed to a mindset shift within Dropbox, emphasizing the importance of\n    meeting customers where they are and supporting them within their existing\n    workflows. Although we faced challenges with leadership and staffing, this\n    experience taught us valuable lessons about proactive planning and\n    sustaining momentum.\n  \n\n	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_dropbox_keeping_flow.html.erb	2025-08-27 23:58:32.101887	2025-09-01 03:09:32.218757	2025-09-01 03:09:32.218757

They wanted to learn and ship quickly and solve real problems with software. Myself and \n    &lt;%= link_to "Trace Wax", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracewax/",\n      target: :blank %&gt;\n    (thoughtbot NYC's Managing Director) established an engagement with the Mayo Clinic focused on building an innovation practice.\n  \n\n  \n    We would develop the innovation practice through building a product. That product would be OnPar; an educational game to improve the continuing education methods for doctors, nurses and residents. This is the story of how we built the product and helped the Mayo Clinic build an innovation practice.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Planning\n  \n\n  \n    In our discovery phase with Mayo, we uncovered a key problem: current continuing education methods for doctors, nurses and residents were not engaging, expensive to produce, and only mildly effective.\n  \n\n  \n    With these insights, I created a customer development interview template and interviewed about 25 healthcare professionals and related stakeholders. The continuing education space had existing competition, but qualitative research supported our assumptions about engagement, expense, and effectiveness issues.\n  \n\n  \n    As the project lead, I took on multiple responsibilities:\n  \n\n  \n    Lead and execute customer development and research\n    Facilitate solution exploration and testing\n    Lead interface and experience design\n    Establish experiment process, setup and analysis\n    Develop the product roadmap and manage the project\n    Communicate with, align, and present to stakeholders\n    Build, manage, and mentor the design team\n  \n\n  \n    As with most successful projects, it takes a village. I was lucky to be surrounded with amazing thoughtbot designers and engineers, and a Mayo Clinic administrative duo. The Mayo Clinic also provided us with world-class doctors to create the case content, as well as a board to lobby for investment.\n  \n\n  \n    Collaborators\n  \n\n  \n    Board\n    \n      Mark Warner, MD\n      Barbara Baasch Thomas\n    \n\n    Mayo Clinicians\n    \n      Richer Berger, MD\n      David Cook, MD\n      Jane Linderbaum, NP\n      Rozalina McCoy, MD\n      Farrell Lloyd, MD\n    \n\n    Mayo Admin\n    \n      Jeannie Poterucha Carter\n      Abhi Bikkani\n    \n\n    Directors\n    \n      Trace Wax\n    \n\n    Designers\n    \n      Ward Penney\n      Tyson Gatch\n    \n\n    Engineers\n    \n      Sean Doyle\n      Eric Collins\n      Christina Entcheva\n      George Brocklehurst\n    \n  \n\n  \n    For this project I chose a lean product approach. We would\n    discover a problem, identify the business, develop the customer, identify\n    risks and assumptions, then build measure and learn from the solutions \n    you ship.\n  \n\n  \n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-process.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The first phase of the project was dedicated to refining the problem space,\n    testing the business idea, establishing goals, and honing in on\n    a specific problem set to solve. \n    &lt;%= link_to "We used the Lean Canvas method made popular by Ash Maurya.",\n      "https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/",\n      target: :blank \n    %&gt;\n  \n\n  \n    The Problem\n  \n  \n    Current continuing education methods for doctors, nurses and residents\n    are not engaging, expensive to produce, and only somewhat effective. \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n    The Goals\n  \n  \n    \n      Create an engaging method of continuing education.\n    \n    \n      Improve effectiveness of continuing education.\n    \n    \n      Reduce the cost of creating content.\n    \n    \n      Have a proven viable business model.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    We did a competitive audit to understand what we were up against, and\n    potentially the size of our market.

This was used to demonstrate the\n        similarities to design thinking and\n        get alignment on using the process\n        for vague problem spaces.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    Designing\n  \n\n  \n    For our first sprint, we tested on a card game as a solution. We\n    incorporated elements we'd heard from our target customers about what might\n    engage them: solving real cases, pitting doctors against an expert\n    clinician, and professionalism. The initial prototype was a physical card\n    game made using index cards.\n  \n\n  \n    \n      &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-prototype.png" %&gt;\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    We set out to test the card game with 15 doctors in the Mayo Clinic. We\n    ended up testing it with around 40. Doctors were not only eager to play, but\n    they were finding other doctors in the clinic to share their experience\n    with, and recommend they play. We had real world referrals to a prototype.\n    Aside for the engaement, the game answered many of our assumptions and\n    helped us understand short term needs and a potential long term direction.\n  \n\n  \n    Our next task\n    was to create a simple digital version of the game and get it out to our\n    target customers to get more feedback. Our team had proficient \n    &lt;%= link_to "Ember", "https://emberjs.com", target: :blank %&gt;\n    engineers, and capable of building powerful javascript apps ripe\n    with interaction, so we decided we'd build a web based app..\n  \n\n  \n    We prioritized a mobile platform as continuing education \n    for doctors was generally done "between things". Often times on a commute, \n    or between appointments. But rarely was this work done at home. When \n    doctors got home, they were tired and wanted to rest.\n  \n\n  \n    Here is the case picking screen. You'll notice the first version is quite\n    bare bones, but offers a few "nice-to-have" features our test groups asked\n    for; the last score a doctor got was displayed, and unplayed cases were\n    separated.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-case-picker-v1.png" %&gt;\n        \n          Version 1 of the case selection screen. Allowing users to pick a case,\n          view par for that case, and get a little detail as to the patient\n          presenting.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-case-picker-v4.png" %&gt;\n        \n          Version 4 showing how we emphaised "real case" to drive engagement, \n          leveraged the Mayo logo to build trust and drive retention, and finally\n          highlighted par to drive more engagement.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    By version 4, we'd made many changes to the case picking screen.\n    The words “real case” meant a lot to the users, so we \n    emphasizing it. By doing so we saw an increase in the number\n    of cases started. However, it also\n    caused a a small reduction in retention. It turns the users now had\n    concerns about PHI (Protected Health Information). We later\n    addressed this on the "meet the patient" screen. \n    Another change was using the Mayo Logo to improve trust.\n    Adding it showed an increase in cases started and retention.\n    Finally, we highlighted "par" (the score to beat) for each case.\n    Doctors told us they were very competitive, and emphasizing the score\n    signaled what to beat. We saw an increase in cases started with\n    lower par numbers, and a reduction of cases started with higher par numbers.\n  \n\n  \n    Another important aspect of the game was being introduced to the patient. We\n    followed the\n    &lt;%= link_to "Grand Rounds",\n      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_rounds", target: :blank %&gt;\n    methodology and maintined that language. On the screen there is an image of\n    a patient, and some basic information about that patient. From here the user\n    goes on to ask questions to this patient.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-patient-information-v1.png" %&gt;\n        \n        \n      \n\n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-patient-information-v3.png" %&gt;\n        \n        \n      \n    \n\n    &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    The initial version uncovered some significant learnings; people were\n    concerned the case might contain PHI (Protected Health Information), images\n    of people were not helpful unless providing diagnostic clues, and finally\n    proper domain language was a must. In our iterations, we addressed these\n    issues in several ways. We highlighted the fact that we removed any PHE. We\n    removed all of the images of people and only used relevant information. And\n    finally, we updated all of our language to be domain language\n  \n\n  \n    After meeting the patient, we were on to game play.\n    Asking a question (playing a card) added 1 to your score.\n    You'd ask a question by dragging a card to the playing field (middle).\n    Once a question was asked, the card would flip, and the answer exposed.\n    You could freely page through all the questions, and diagnose\n    the patient whenever you wanted..\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-play-v1.png" %&gt;\n        \n        \n      \n\n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-play-v5.png" %&gt;\n        \n        \n      \n    \n\n    &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    Through interviews and data we learned a lot, and made adjustments. Doctors\n    were not happy that all questions had the same cost to play - they felt some\n    questions or test should cost more. Adding variable costs to cards increased\n    retention. Our original game mechanics were janky; it wasn't obvious where\n    to drop the card, once you'd asked 4 questions it was nearly impossible to\n    scroll up, and not being able to easily revisit the patient information\n    provided uneccesary friction.\n  \n\n  \n    The climax of the game was the diagnosis screen.\n    Here was the chance for the user to make their diagnosis and\n    solve the case.\n    The original screen was quite simple,\n    the user could see par, review the questions they asked,\n    and make a diagnosis. Once they made the diagnosis, they were\n    either correct and celebrated, or wrong and shown the correct answer.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-diagnose-v1.png" %&gt;\n        \n        \n      \n\n      \n        &lt;%= image_tag "works/mayo-clinic-educational-game-diagnose-v4.png" %&gt;\n        \n        \n      \n    \n\n    &lt;%= render "carousels/actions" %&gt;\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    During our in-person interviews there were a lot of “I knew its” and “oh no,\n    it can’t be that” on this screen. There was a lot of emotion from the \n    users. The question most often asked when the diagnosis was wrong was\n    "how did the expert do it?". They were curious what questions would\n    have been a better line of thought.\n    The biggest win we had in the product was adding adding a section\n    that showed the line of questioning an expert took to solve it.\n    By adding this, we say a significant increase in cases played and\n    overall retention.\n  \n\n  \n    Ultimately the iterations proved successful as we saw\n    steady engagement, an upwards trend in acquisition,\n    good 30 day retention (adding new cases was the only driver of\n    continued retention), and signal of customers willing to pay.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    The Impact\n  \n\n  \n    After extensive testing and pivoting, we discovered a successful business\n    model for OnPar. Our shift from targeting individual users to focusing on\n    those invested in learning and credentialing led us to two types of paying\n    customers.\n  \n\n  \n    Firstly, nurse organizations desired our platform for ongoing education,\n    curated content dissemination, and tracking participant engagement.\n  \n\n  \n    Secondly, larger organizations like the CDC saw the value in leveraging our\n    platform for urgent messaging, improved communication, and more accurate\n    tracking compared to their existing systems.\n  \n\n  \n    These distinct customer perspectives guided our final pivot, resulting in a\n    problem-solution fit and a group of paying customers. Moreover, the Mayo\n    Clinic team gained valuable insights in product development,\n    decision-making, customer engagement, iteration, and innovation. This\n    successful product launch marked the establishment of the Mayo Clinic's\n    digital innovation lab.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    The Challenges\n  \n\n  \n    The biggest challenge with this project was changing the mindset of the Mayo\n    Clinic from shipping something perfect, to shipping something to learn. The\n    two things we struggle with was shipping something scrappy under the Mayo\n    brand, and keeping the board aligned with learning as progress. We focused\n    on metrics often to show progress, but struggled with expressing how\n    important the qualitative learnings were, and that a failed version of an\n    A/B test was a path forward, not a set back. This took a lot of hand\n    holding, weekly meetings, and education. I leveraged the \n    &lt;%= link_to "Stop, Pivot, or Preserve framework", post_path(14) %&gt;\n    framework to disclose learings and progress, as well as force\n    alignment and decision making as a team.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Learnings\n  \n\n  \n    Our key realization was that we initially targeted the wrong paying customer\n    for the project. While doctors and residents found value in the product,\n    they were reluctant to pay for it. Nurses were willing to pay, but we\n    couldn't sustain their engagement beyond 60 days. Ultimately, department\n    heads emerged as the paying customer, benefiting from the product's insights\n    into residents and nurses, enabling them to address knowledge gaps and track\n    performance in their organizations.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Closing\n  \n\n  \n    The collaboration between thoughtbot and the Mayo Clinic resulted in OnPar,\n    an innovative educational game for healthcare professionals. Through a lean\n    product approach and iterative design, the team addressed the shortcomings\n    of traditional continuing education methods. OnPar successfully launched,\n    attracting paying customers such as nurse organizations and larger\n    institutions like the CDC. project established the Mayo Clinic's digital\n    innovation lab and provided valuable insights into product development,\n    customer engagement, and innovation in healthcare. OnPar represents a\n    cultural shift in the Mayo Clinic.\n  \n\n	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_mayo_gamifying_medical_education.html.erb	2025-08-27 23:58:32.102224	2025-09-01 03:09:32.24195	2025-09-01 03:09:32.24195

There are loads of buttons that help you spend money, but very few buttons to help you save. Piggy brings the save button to the forefront and helps people develop better money-saving habits one day at a time.\n  \n\n  \n    A friend and I got into a discussion about how difficult it is to save money. Our conversation shifted to how our culture is a spending culture - we are pushed to spend but not to save. In our personal lives, spending occurs daily while saving occurs bi-weekly or monthly. We are very good at spending because we practice it daily, but the opposite is true of saving. As a result, spending feels easy and seamless, while saving money feels like a chore and takes effort.\n  \n\n  \n    Moreover, we both lacked confidence in our ability to save. We felt that our spending habits were bad. We recalled that when we did have extra cash, we usually ended up spending it on socializing or unnecessary things.\n  \n\n  \n    The Problem\n  \n\n  \n    I want to save money, but my current saving habits and lack of extra cash make it very difficult to save money.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Planning\n  \n\n  \n    Our next step was to do customer discovery and see if others shared this pain. Before diving into solutions, we wanted to see if other people had a similar relationship with money. We created a short list of questions and started with 5 in-person interviews.\n  \n\n  \n    Key Findings\n  \n\n  \n    Most people desired to save more money\n    Most people spend money every day\n    Most people had spendable income\n    Half of the people said they did not have good saving habits\n    Some people said they didn't budget\n    Few people said they spend "too much"\n    Few people said they are often encouraged by others to save money\n    Few people saved directly out of their paycheck\n  \n\n  \n    These responses validated that people wanted to save money, but their saving habits were poor. However, our assumption that lack of extra cash led to difficulty saving was invalidated. We observed that extra cash wasn't viewed as money they should save, rather there was a perception that extra cash could be spent. After the interviews, we modified our problem statement:\n  \n\n  \n    Modified Problem Statement\n  \n\n  \n    I have extra money that I want to save, but I have bad saving habits.\n  \n\n  \n    At this point we felt confident that people resonated with our problem statement and decided it was time for an abbreviated design sprint.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Designing\n  \n\n  \n    Almost right away we had an interesting finding. While looking at our competition, we noticed that most existing tools were directed at helping people get context around their money. They "helped" people save by offering budgets or attempting to automate the saving process.\n  \n\n  \n    Looking at our competition was eye-opening. It didn't seem that anyone had actively focused on developing a person's saving habit. Rather, existing tools aimed to help people save money by monitoring spending habits. We kept this top of mind as we went through the sprint.\n  \n\n  \n    As we diverged, we continually found ourselves digging into the belief that: People's saving habits will be improved if we engage them in saving daily.\n  \n\n  \n    As we continued to sketch out solutions, we refined that statement further: Providing a person with daily encouragement and reminders to save their leftover spending cash will help develop better saving habits.\n  \n\n  \n    From here we developed a user journey to help guide us through building our prototype. As we refined a potential solution, we surfaced many assumptions about our users that we needed to test.\n  \n\n  \n    Key Assumptions\n  \n\n  \n    People will use one account for all daily spending\n    People want to be reminded to save money daily\n    People want the option to save\n    People will save out of spending cash, separate from bills\n  \n\n  \n    Next we set out to build a prototype to test with users. Based on the outcome from the sprint, we started to build a prototype to test that our solution was viable and addressed our riskiest assumptions.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Impact\n  \n\n  \n    We ran 7 user tests with our target market: people who made $80K+, currently wanted to save money, and felt that they had bad saving habits. We weren't entirely confident that this was our target market, but that was the group we had gotten the most positive feedback from.\n  \n\n  \n    The user tests were a great success. Not only did we uncover some interface and experience problems, but we got a lot of positive feedback and validation that being prompted to save money felt empowering and different from other tools. About half of the users asked to be notified when the application was to be released without being prompted.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Challenges\n  \n\n  \n    Before we started to develop the MVP Piggy application, we spiked on the engineering side. We quickly ran into difficult technical hurdles. The immediate problem we faced was facilitating the transfer of funds from a checking account to a savings account. We were able to find a means to do so, but at a high cost. The best solution we found would cost each user $10 per month.\n  \n\n  \n    With a cost that high, we didn't believe that our complete solution would be viable. Five options we were considering:\n  \n\n  \n    Don't have a save button, rather remind and suggest an amount to save\n    Partner with a bank to get free access to the API to facilitate money transfers\n    Find a better/free solution to facilitate money transferring\n    Create a better/free solution to facilitate money transferring\n    Get users to pay\n  \n\n  \n    We wanted to pursue the third option, while considering the first option to be our MVP. We felt that although you couldn't save money using the application, the daily reminders and encouragement would still be useful. Our end goal is to provide the means to directly save money without any charge to the customer, so option 5 is out of the picture for now. But before we could take this path we went in search of a buyer.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Learnings\n  \n\n  \n    The most interesting learning was finding the buyer. Free products are never free. If a product is free, then the user is the product. With that in mind we started to look into how helping a person save money was monetizable. Through some of my partner's connections, we were able to sit down with people from American Express and Citi Bank.\n  \n\n  \n    What we learned was obvious in hindsight. Banks pay a great deal of money to get an individual to open a checking or savings account. If we could use this app to guide people to opening an account, it was an acquisition play for the banks. Moreover, the more money a person has in their account, the more the bank can leverage that money. It's a win-win for the user and the bank.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Closing\n  \n\n  \n    The development of the Piggy application has addressed the challenge of saving money in a spending-centric culture. By actively engaging users in daily saving habits through reminders and encouragement, Piggy sets itself apart from existing tools focused on monitoring spending. User testing validated its effectiveness, receiving positive feedback. Challenges related to technical hurdles and high costs for fund transfers prompted exploration of alternative options, including partnerships with banks. The journey also revealed the potential for Piggy to serve as an acquisition tool for financial institutions. Overall, Piggy offers a practical solution to improve saving habits and benefits both users and banks.\n  \n\n	Case Study	\N	0.95	app/views/works/_we_ate_the_web_saving_money.html.erb	2025-08-27 23:58:32.101765	2025-09-01 03:09:32.266492	2025-09-01 03:09:32.266492

18	The Value Based Product Designer	This week on Draft\r\n\r\nLast week’s Revise Weekly lesson was about repeat sales from past customers. This week’s is about a related aspect: referrals from past customers to existing ones.\r\nThis fortnight’s Draft Analysis will be about shaving darlings Harry’s. I am a secret shaving snob, so this will be fun.\r\nThe Problem With Images\r\nIn a recent letter, I chatted about the ideal format for a case study, using Draft’s most recent one as an example. A few noted that I had a screenshot there – but given its size & crop ratio, along with the lack of a link back to the page in question, it wasn’t really helpful as a visual.\r\n\r\nThat is by design. If you’re a designer who focuses primarily on business value, then you should not have visuals in your portfolio, no matter how visually-oriented of a designer you may be.\r\n\r\nI know this is easy to say as a designer who focuses on text, layout, and behavior. Yet with visual portfolios, it is even more essential to omit visuals from any public expression of your work.\r\n\r\nThe constraint: economic buyers can’t read the meaning of images\r\n\r\nWhen we start out as designers, we’re so conversant in visual language that we’re utterly shocked when clients and stakeholders can’t understand our underlying thinking.\r\n\r\nYet over time, we come to understand that they’re coming to the engagement with their own motives, and we need to express our thinking in advance of sharing new work. Most of one’s growth as a designer comes in the form of strategic communication skills: pitching new work, justifying various decisions, and crafting a game plan of potential tradeoffs that may occur during a critique session.\r\n\r\nAs a result, when a value-based designer is about to engage in critique, they spend considerable time and energy setting up their thinking before sharing images. That keeps the conversation focused on the right goals, and allows us to justify strategic direction without regressing to a discussion of personal preferences or arbitrary, self-constructed goals.\r\n\r\nThink about a situation in your career where mockups were shared prematurely, or without annotation. It’s nearly certain that the client misinterpreted the work, leading to way more backpedaling and damage control than would be appropriate in any engagement. This isn’t good or bad; it’s a natural consequence of all humans being visual thinkers, and we need to view it as a necessary constraint of our profession, no matter if we’re purely visual (illustrators, etc), functional (interaction design, strategy), or somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nThe consequences\r\n\r\nThe tendency of economic buyers – no, humans – to downplay a designer’s thinking in favor of visuals has three key consequences. Any one of these should be enough to justify never using visuals in your portfolio again.\r\n\r\nConsequence 1: Visual portfolios don’t build consensus\r\n\r\nThe goal of a portfolio is to convey your thinking and focus. Good portfolios get a prospective client to come around to your point of view. As a result, they provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate your focus on the economic value that design can provide for their business.\r\n\r\nThe constraint here is that you are communicating, mostly, to strangers. You lack the luxury of an existing client relationship, and you’re probably passively selling your work to a growing audience on your website. What about a visual in and of itself is capable of this, in the face of the headwinds your design practice already faces?\r\n\r\nConsequence 2: Visual portfolios distract from your thinking\r\n\r\nVisuals are useful for conveying your overall style, which is unfortunately of no business importance to the reader.\r\n\r\nValue-based designers know work begets work. This is great for building up a reputation over time, especially within a specific positioning – but it also means that if prospective clients see any visuals, they will hire you in order to stamp out a clone of a past project – not to provide business value.\r\n\r\nConsequence 3: Visuals fundamentally can’t bolster a business argument\r\n\r\nYou are there to convey two things to the reader:\r\n\r\nDesign has business value. It’s 2017 and nobody knows this. I know. It’s dumb. You still have to undo all the damage that designer-artists have done – and continue to do – to the integrity of our profession over the past 30 years.\r\nYou use design as a tool to create business results. This should be self-explanatory. It proves you’re a safe bet. It shows you will provide a more reliable return on the company’s investment.\r\nIf someone sees a visual, they’re going to focus on the visual. And if they focus on the visual, they’re not going to fully understand the challenge, thinking, operational issues, and ultimately value-based upside that you’re capable of providing to a client.\r\n\r\nPretty’s cheap; strategy has real value\r\n\r\nEvery time you add a visual, you are downplaying the importance of any other text you’ve written. And there is nothing more important than the text. Nothing.\r\n\r\nThat’s why designers should use at least 1,000 words of explanation, justification, and business strategy per mockup shared to the client. Fortunately, in your portfolio, you can explain yourself however you want – without the need to share any images.\r\n\r\nThis is a letter from Draft, written by Nick Disabato. If you want to share it with others, here’s a permalink.\r\n\r\nDon’t want to hear from me anymore? No hard feelings.

7	Designing For Flow	One of my favorite concepts is flow. Flow is a state in which you are working, and nothing else matters. It's that span of time that felt like 5 minutes, but could have been 50.\r\n\r\nMihály Csíkszentmihályi wrote a book about it in the 90's - it's full of great studies, findings and insights about the attributes of activity that put people into flow. Even better, it suggests the flow might equal happiness. \r\n\r\nWhen I first encountered flow, around 2011, I was seeking an understanding of how to love ones work. It took me several years, many podcasts, many other books and a second reading of Csíkszentmihályi's book to catch the connection with design and flow. \r\n\r\nIt was obvious now that I look back, but because I was seeking an answer about how I could find flow, I wasn't looking at how I could design situations for other people to be in flow. I create experiences, solutions and interfaces constantly. People interact with my work on a daily basis - can I use flow to improve their lives?\r\n\r\nWhen I first approached designing for flow, I questioned the motivation. Was I going to use flow to improve my app's retention metric so I could prove that the app had value? Or, was I using the principals of flow to create a great and engaging experience for the user to bring them joy. It was important to me that I was transparent - even if just to myself for the moment. I didn't want any hidden agenda.\r\n\r\nAs I worked through the question internally, I came to a relatively simple solution to keep me on the right track when designing. I looked at all of the elements of flow, and asked myself with each one, is this for the user or for the application? \r\n\r\nThe elements of flow:\r\n\r\n* A clear goal\r\n* A concentrated field\r\n* Immediate feedback\r\n* The balance between using your skills and being challenged\r\n* A feeling of control\r\n* Ease of the journey\r\n* An altered perception of time\r\n\r\nWhen I design a solution for a person's problem, I try my best to empathize with them. I want to understand their pain points, and design solutions that help remove those pain points and let them achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nwas I helping them transparently achieve their goal, or was I putting them on a path that lead them to achieving my goal, not theirs. As a good designer, this should come natural\r\n\r\n\r\n[Flow](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow)\r\n[The 8 Elements of Flow](http://www.flowskills.com/the-8-elements-of-flow.html)\r\n\r\n[Flow White Paper](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/courses/imgd5100/papers/FlowQuestionnaire.pdf]	f	2017-03-27 02:05:00	2017-03-27 02:05:39.948296	2017-04-02 15:19:32.736261		designing-for-flow	\N	\N

6	Design Sprint Map for Heroes	==The [design sprint] is a tool to identify the biggest potential risk in your product and to design a solution around it.== As a fan of the Google Ventures sprint model, I wanted to share a somewhat detailed summary of one of the first steps: the sprint map.\r\n\r\n## The Sprint Map\r\n\r\nThe sprint map should be done on the first day. ==This map will be your guiding light throughout the sprint process. It will help keep you on topic and your idea focused on the part of your product where you can make the biggest difference.== As an added benefit, the construction of the map will get the entire team thinking together and committed to the process.\r\n\r\n### What you need:\r\n\r\n* 1 hour\r\n* A sprint facilitator\r\n* The dedicated attention of the sprint team\r\n* Whiteboard\r\n* Whiteboard markers\r\n\r\n### How to draw the map:\r\n\r\nThe facilitator is responsible for collecting the teams thoughts on the whiteboard.  They should try their best to avoid interpreting the team's thoughts, but if and when they do, they should be sure to ask the team "does this look right?". ==It is important that the facilitator makes sure that the team's thoughts are captured, and the result is not just the interpretation or ideas of the facilitator.==\r\n\r\nAs the facilitator stands at the whiteboard, they should help the team through\r\nthe steps of creating the map:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Left to right\r\n\r\nOn the far left side of the whiteboard, list the characters that will be most prominent in this story. ==I try to think of the map as the quest of a hero. There is the hero with a goal, and all of the integral characters they meet along the way.== Sometimes the story can break into side stories of the supporting characters, but in the end it revolves around our hero.\r\n\r\nJot down the characters on the left starting with the hero. Write who they will meet along their journey in stack formation (in order top to bottom) to complete their goal. Typically there are 2-4 characters.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-characters%402x.png)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Far right\r\n\r\nThe far right is the goal of our hero. ==The end goal is the something that our hero is trying to attain. It is usually something tangible or service oriented.== For instance: the hero wants a meal, a bicycle route, a recommendation for the best seats at the opera. The more concise this is, the easier the map will be to create (and to be honest, the entire product).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-goal%402x.png)\r\n\r\n#### 3. Map the journey\r\n\r\nThe final step is to map all of the happenings between the hero and the goal. When the hero meets a key character along the way we can write this key step as the action of the key character or the overarching result of their interaction. This journey should involve all of the key characters and their role in the journey.  If a key character doesn't participate in this path then they should be removed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![design sprint map: step 3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/design-sprint-map-complete%402x.png)\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\n* Keep the map simple. Try to limit the journey to no more than 20 happenings.\r\n* Try to limit the amount of characters to 4\r\n* Get the group involved. Make sure the entire team is participating. As each step is drawn, ask the room "does this look right?"\r\n* Don't be afraid to erase. This process is flexible. Keep erasing or writing new ideas until it feels right.\r\n\r\n[design sprint]:http://www.gv.com/sprint/\r\n	t	2016-08-07 12:33:00	2016-08-08 01:34:53.803755	2023-07-14 18:04:45.111303	Design Sprint Map for Heroes	design-sprint-map-for-heroes		\N
3	The Action	==The second step to creating a lean experiment is identifying the user's action\r\nthat that can validate or invalidate your assumption.== This action can\r\ntake place in your application or completely outside of it.\r\n\r\nIf your assumption states that a user needs X, what action does that user\r\ndemonstrate to get X? If your users won't do Y, what action do take to avoid Y?\r\n==Ideally you want to find a real "currency" exchange and get the user\r\ncomplete the action.== Something that is of value to the user.\r\n\r\n==The user action should be measurable== otherwise you will not be able to\r\nidentify success or failure of your experiment. I find it easiest to measure\r\nactions in occurrences.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Our users don't trust our application with their bank information.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users enter their bank information in our application.\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Our users need verbal support to run further.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users run further.\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Our users want the convenience of a one-click grocery buy.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users click a buy now button.\r\n1. **Assumption:**\r\n   Users want to share their music with other users.\r\n   **Action:**\r\n   Users click a share button.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nTry to think of the simplest action a user could take to validate or invalidate\r\nyour assumption. It doesn't always have to be in your application, but typically\r\nit is more difficult to measure an action outside of your application. ==It\r\nshould feel obvious to you what action a user will take that gives you\r\nvalidation.==\r\n	t	2016-07-16 13:33:00	2016-07-20 13:34:10.442041	2023-07-14 18:05:10.801051	Setting Up An Experiment: The Action	the-action		\N

22	What the hell is an MPV?	Working as a consultant, I am always pushing for an MVP. Why? Because they are less expensive to build, and frankly, most poeople don't know what to build. And they shouldn't. Not until a bunch of people are using it, and they can communicate the value of the product. So, let's chat about an MVP - a minimum viable product. \r\n\r\nAn MVP should be 3 things:\r\n\r\n* the least amount of features needed to get the job done\r\n* a journey that is achievable without so much frustration, people quit\r\n* something that adds value\r\n\r\nLet's use IKEA furniture as an example. If I you needed a bed to sleep on and I shipped you a MALBA bed with no instructions, could you build it and have a nice comfy bed to sleep on? Yeah, but with a lot of anguish. It satisfies points one and three, but not two. If people give up because it's so hard, I wouldn't call it an MVP, I'd call it an MP.\r\n\r\nIf we take it a step further and throw some instructions in there, then we've got something. The journey isn't perfect, but it can be accomplished without expending a ton of energy trying to figure it out.\r\n\r\nOne simple way to determine if your product is an MPV is to run a usability test with it. Give your users some goals, and watch them play with it. If they say "I don't know what to do now", and they can't figure it out while spending a reasonable amount of energy, you've got a problem.\r\n\r\nMVPs should be _good enough_ so a user can accomplish their goals without wanting to quit and they should know what to do at each screen to get value out of it.\r\n\r\nNext time you are building an MVP, don't think about how awesome it is, think about how clear it is, and how smooth it is for a user to accomplish their immediate goal. 	f	2017-12-07 02:35:00	2017-12-07 02:45:30.978681	2017-12-07 02:45:30.978681		what-the-hell-is-an-mpv	\N	\N
15	Asking the right questions	"The only reliable way to gather this evidence is by exploring what customers did in the past or will do in the present. Asking them what they’ll do in the future, e.g. “Will you use…”, puts you in the land of biases and should be avoided." -- Ash Murya\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.leanstack.com/the-updated-problem-interview-script-and-a-new-canvas-1e43ff267a5d?inf_contact_key=27e844604ee506a7e0fd4f675098878f7c41e023edf3be67716618e10eb81dee	f	2017-08-22 02:12:00	2017-08-22 02:12:45.951847	2017-08-22 02:12:45.951847		asking-the-right-questions	\N	\N
25	Lego MVP Warm-up	As Product Designers we build MVPs often. To help get into the mindset of "minimum and viable" I like to play a game with a couple people that forces prioritization.

They cannot talk. \r\n- Go around the table clockwise, one person at a time, guessing what the piece is.\r\n- If someone gets it right, the game stops.\r\n- Once everyone has guessed the game stops.\r\n\r\n*Note - if you think the person built what you added to the hat, don’t guess.\r\n\r\n## Scoring\r\n- If your presentation was guessed correctly by anyone, you get points. \r\n- If you guess the presentation, you get points.\r\n\r\n|| Number of legos | Presenter Points | Guesser Points ||\r\n|-| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |-|\r\n|| 10              | 1                 | 1                        ||\r\n|| 9                | 2                 | 2                        ||\r\n|| 8                | 3                 | 3                        ||\r\n|| 7                | 4                 | 4                        ||\r\n|| 6                | 5                 | 5                        ||\r\n|| 5                | 6                 | 6                        ||\r\n|| 4                | 7                 | 7                        ||\r\n|| 3                | 8                 | 8                        ||\r\n|| 2                | 9                 | 9                        ||\r\n|| 1                | 10               | 10                      ||	t	2023-05-31 14:15:00	2023-05-31 14:27:54.864451	2023-05-31 17:58:14.130463	Build an MVP with Legos	lego-mvp-warm-up		\N
26	Blind App Review	I was recently given the prompt in an interview to "evaluate, provide feedback on creative work, and communicate improvements on design". It's a robust prompt — and it came in the form a a blind app review focused on the creative conception of a product. I love it. A big part of being a designer is being able to give critical feedback and recognize areas for improvement. \r\n\r\nI wanted to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. My goal was to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can help create a better product.  \r\n\r\nHere is the approach I took:\r\n\r\n# My Approach\r\n\r\n1. [Say Hi](#say-hi)\r\n1. [Intro The Process](#intro-the-process)\r\n1. [Familiarize](#familiarize)\r\n1. [Evaluate UI/UX](#evaluate-ui-ux)\r\n1. [Analyze Brand Expression](#analyze-brand-expression)\r\n1. [Assess Aesthetics And Taste](#assess-aethetics-and-taste)\r\n1. [Identify The Good And Bad](#identify-the-good-and-bad)\r\n1. [Propose Changes](#propose-changes)\r\n<div class="u-padding-bottom-x-large"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="say-hi"></a>\r\n## 1. Say Hi \r\n\r\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the pressure, and challenge, of an interview - let alone a blind app review. Start off slow, say hi, and show your warmth first.  Don’t forget that you're working with another person. Demonstrating your expertise is great, and showing how you include others and leverage the skills around you is a multiplier. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="intro-the-process"></a>\r\n## 2. Intro The Process\r\n\r\nIntroduce the interviewer(s) to your process. Show them you have one, and let them follow along.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="familiarize"></a>\r\n## 3. Familiarize\r\n\r\nSpend some time exploring and interacting with the app. This will help you understand its functionalities, user interface (UI), and user experience (UX).\r\n\r\n- What is your first impression?\r\n- What are the positive aspects?\r\n- What immediately jumps out that can be improved?\r\n- What you think the main jobs-to-be-done or problems solved are?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="evaluate-ui-ux"></a>\r\n## 4. Evaluate UI/UX\r\n\r\nAssess the visual elements, layout, and overall user interface design of the app. \r\n\r\n- Is the interface intuitive and easy to navigate?\r\n- Are the buttons, icons, and other interactive elements clear and understandable?\r\n- Does the app provide feedback and guidance to the user effectively?\r\n- Does the app follow established UI/UX design principles?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="analyze-brand-expression"></a>\r\n## 5. Analyze Brand Expression\r\nEvaluate how well the app communicates and represents its brand.\r\n\r\n- Is the branding consistent throughout the app?\r\n- Does the app reflect the brand's values and tone?\r\n- Does the app reflect the brand's identity?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="assess-aesthetics-and-taste"></a>\r\n## 6. Assess Aesthetics And Taste\r\nEvaluate the overall visual appeal and style of the app. Consider the following questions:\r\n\r\n- Is the app visually pleasing and engaging?\r\n- Does the color scheme, typography, and graphics enhance the user experience?\r\n- Does the app align with current design trends or demonstrate a unique and innovative approach?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="identify-the-good-and-bad"></a>\r\n## 7. Identify The Good And Bad\r\nBased on your evaluation, pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the app. Focus on the end user experience.\r\n\r\n- What aspects of the app are working well and enhancing the user experience?\r\n- What aspects could be improved to make the app more user-friendly, efficient, or enjoyable?\r\n- Are there any usability issues or pain points that should be addressed?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="propose-changes"></a>\r\n## 8. Propose Changes\r\nOffer specific recommendations for improvements based on your evaluation. <mark>Try proposing in the form of problem solving approaches as well.</mark>\r\n\r\n- How would you address the identified issues or challenges?\r\n- What changes would you suggest to enhance the app's UI, UX, brand expression, or aesthetics?\r\n- How can the app better solve problems or meet the needs of the end user?\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="u-padding-bottom-x-large"></div>\r\n\r\nTry to approach the critique from the perspective of improving the app and enhancing the end user experience. Your goal is to provide valuable insights and suggestions that can create a better product.\r\n\r\n# 🤞	t	2023-06-07 15:20:00	2023-06-07 15:23:21.497144	2023-07-12 19:29:42.376941	Doing A Blind App Review In An Interview	blind-app-review		\N
19	Validation Early On	\r\nIn the early stages of your product journey, you won't much (if any) data that suggest your product will be a success. However, ==you should have confidence that there is a potential business behind the problem you are solving, and that other people want that problem solved.==\r\n\r\nIf you feel that sense of confidence, you should continue to move forward and spend energy on gathering quantitative information that there are more than 5-10 potential customers. Think of this as high-level market research. ==We want to gather quantitative data to build more confidence that there is a market interested in your unique value proposition.==\r\n\r\nWe want to put our idea in front of as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and learn if those people resonate with the problem we are solving and the unique value proposition. There are three questions we want to answer:\r\n\r\n* How many potential customers identify with the problem?\r\n* How many potential customers will investigate into solutions?\r\n* How many potential customers will commit to a currency exchange for a solution?\r\n\r\nTo answer the above questions, we can run a variety of experiments that reach a large audience, elicit a behavior from individuals that demonstrate an interest in your unique value proposition, and solicit a currency exchange from individuals in that audience to demonstrates a willingness to pay for a solution.\r\n\r\nAssuming you have already done your customer development (if not, get out of the building!), a next good step might be the [Google Keywords](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/validation-with-google-keywords) research method. This should help you build more confidence that a larger audience is looking for a solution to the problem you want to solve. A more advanced experiment to get a far better sense of validation is the [Facebook/AdWords Ad Experiment](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/validation-with-facebook-ads). Probably the best validation experiment you can run is the [Fake Door](https://data36.com/fake-door-testing/) experiment. \r\n\r\n==Most products fail because nobody wants them.== Don't be that person - do some customer development and idea validation before you spend so much of your valuable time building something nobody is going to use. \r\n	t	2017-09-12 19:48:00	2017-09-12 13:49:00.549241	2023-07-14 18:01:29.498435	Validation Early On	validation-early-on		\N
17	Validation with Google Keywords	One of the quickest methods to gain confidence in your product is the [Google Aords Keyword Planner Tool](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/) <mark>You can leverage it to get real data that shows how often people are searching the problem you hope to solve.</mark> \r\n\r\n## Example: \r\n\r\nYou want to deliver emoji-cupcakes because you felt that there was a lack of bakeries that offered them. After some research, you've learned that this is true in your region. You've talked to 10 people who also feel the same way, and would love an emoji-cupcake delivery service. During your conversations with them, you also uncovered a new problem. Of those who ordered emoji-cupcakes in the past, the ordering process is complex and the variety limiting. \r\n\r\nYou're feeling pretty good about this, and you want some more validation. This is where the Google Adwords Keyword Planner tool comes in. Let's run an experiment.\r\n\r\n## Setting up the experiment\r\n\r\nWith this experiment, we use the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool to identify:\r\n\r\n* How many people are searching for "emoji-cupcake delivery"\r\n* What countries/regions/states/cities is that search is most common\r\n* Is there competition for this business idea\r\n\r\nTo get started, define the keywords that you think are important to this search. Some suggestions: *emoji-cupcake, emoji-cookie, emoji-cupcake delivery, cupcake delivery*. Once you have those, check out how they fair using the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool.\r\n\r\n## Analyzing the results\r\n\r\nAfter you run the query, you will get results that contain your keywords and related search phrases. You can use this to draw some high-level conclusions.\r\n\r\n### Search Volume\r\n\r\nSearch volume will give you an idea of the level of interest for each search phrase. If nobody is using your search phrases or similar search phrases, then there probably isn't much demand for the idea. \r\n\r\nLike most of these early-stage experiments, you have to determine the success threshold. Do 10k searches per month make you feel like there is a market for what you are selling? 100k? 1 million? \r\n\r\n### Suggested Bid\r\n\r\nWe can hypothesize that if a suggested bid is high, then a person is willing to pay for that solution/product. The idea is that advertisers are willing to pay for these ads at this high price, so they must be worth to warrant the expense.\r\n\r\nCombine this with the search volume for more insight. A high volume and high suggested bid could mean that there is a lot of people searching for a solution, and a lot of people willing to pay for it.\r\n\r\n### Specificity\r\n\r\nThe number of words in the search phrase can also be insightful. Let's say you tested "chores". You will probably see a lot of search volume, but we don’t really know what the user was looking for. The user could have been looking for a list, perhaps a snack called "chores". We can't be too sure. However, if we make the search phrase more specific like “how to share chores with roommates”, we have a much better idea of what problem the user is trying to solve.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources\r\n\r\n<small>* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qtT9o--kQ</small>	t	2017-07-25 14:15:00	2017-09-11 20:56:26.128778	2023-07-14 18:02:19.688595	Validate Your Business Idea With Google Keywords 	validation-with-google-keywords		\N
16	Validation with Facebook Ads 	Before you start building the world’s most awesome app, it’s a good idea to find out if people want it. I know it’s hard to believe others might not love your idea, but unfortunately, not everybody likes the same stuff. If we find out others have interest, you can avoid wasting time and money building something nobody wants.\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ads experiment will give you a high-level understanding around the following:\r\n\r\n- if you have a strong unique value proposition\r\n- if people desire to learn more about your idea, and\r\n- which audience cares the most about it\r\n\r\n<mark>This experiment will not give you proof - this experiment will give you confidence.</mark> Wouldn't it be nice to have confidence that someone other than your best friend likes your idea?\r\n\r\n# The Experiment\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ads experiment leverages Facebook’s large and diverse user base and its rich data about those users. With this data, you can target specific audiences and uncover the level of interest in your idea.\r\n\r\nEach experiment will involve running 2 ads to A/B test against. Each ad has a design that highlights the unique value proposition and targets a specific audience. <mark>In each experiment, you isolate a variable to uncover which one garners interest. Those variables could be the unique value proposition, design, or audience.</mark>\r\n\r\n## Getting set up\r\n\r\nIn order to run this experiment you will need a few things:\r\n\r\n- An idea for an app.\r\n- At least one Unique Value Proposition (UVP) - it’s okay to have more than one.\r\n- A well-defined audience that will be using your app.\r\n- A Facebook account\r\n- _Optional but highly recommended: Facebook page *_\r\n- _Optional but highly recommended: Splash page **_\r\n\r\n<small>\r\n* If you want your ad to appear in the Facebooks users’ news feeds, you will need a Facebook page and a website. A simple Facebook page with an image and a single post saying coming soon will cover the page. A simple splash site stating your UVP and a "coming soon" will work.\r\n</small>\r\n\r\n<small>**If you do create the splash page, you could incorporate a currency exchange. This would allow people to pay or sign up to be on a waiting list. Here is an example of a somewhat in-depth splash page to test a currency exchange http://www.nillyapp.com/ </small>\r\n\r\n## Running the ads\r\n\r\nTo run the ads, visit https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads. You will need to log into your Facebook account to create the ads. I won’t go into great detail about how to do actually create the ads since the UI changes so often, but I will cover the main points. \r\n\r\n### Ad Type\r\n\r\nIdeally, you want an ad that is meant to generate leads. You could create an ad that drives people to a Facebook page, but you wouldn’t benefit from the possible currency exchange of a splash page. Regardless of what type of ad you pick, make sure that you are charged per click. Clicks are a low-level form of validation.\r\n\r\n### Audience & Placements\r\n\r\nChose an audience that is narrow. A large vague audience makes it more difficult to determine who is interested in your idea. You have the option to run ads just on Facebook, on Instagram, or on their entire ad network. If you believe that one of those areas doesn’t apply to you, then feel free to cut it out. Just make sure that you are consistent with all the ads.\r\n\r\n### Budget & Schedule\r\n\r\nEach ad should run for at least 7 days. I tend to spend about $100 to start. It's really up to you.\r\n\r\n### Design & Content\r\n\r\nDesign and content encompass the format, media, page, and links. You will want to create a simple ad that shows your UVP and has a call to action. Here is an example ad:\r\n\r\n![Example Facebook Ad](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad%402x.png)\r\n\r\n## Taking action with each test\r\n\r\nFor the best results, you'll want to run at least 3 A/B tests. If the first 3 A/B tests return mixed results, you may want to run up to 6 A/B tests. I'll do my best to guide you from where to start and then based off of your results, where to go next. \r\n\r\n## Determining success\r\n\r\nBare in mind that these A/B test will return a single data point for you to compare results - clicks per impressions. You have to determine what success looks like. Different ideas should have different thresholds.\r\nIf your idea is hard to execute and you need many users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be very high. If your idea is easy to execute and needs a few users, the amount of clicks per impressions you need might be low.\r\n\r\nTry to answer these questions to determine a success threshold:\r\n\r\n- How difficult do you think it will be to execute on your idea?\r\n- How many users do you think you will need to be successful?\r\n- How much competition is there for your idea?\r\n- What is the average lifetime value of a customer?\r\n- What is the average cost for this kind of product?\r\n- What is the size of your audience?\r\n\r\n## Things to avoid\r\n\r\nAvoid the desire to get clicks! Keep in mind that just getting clicks isn’t going to teach you anything - you need to know why you got the clicks. This is not about advertising best practices. You can throw words like “free” and “limited time” that will encourage clicks, but we don’t want that. <mark>We want an ad that tests only the value of your idea and the audiences that see it.</mark>\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable outcomes is to identify that your idea doesn’t resonate with anybody.  You save all the time and money it takes to build something nobody needs.\r\n\r\n# Experiments\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with style variable\r\n\r\nThis test will help you identify if your unique value proposition garners interest from a particular audience. You can run a single ad by itself, but I prefer to run 2 ads with the same content but different styles. This helps create a variable and a control to use for comparison. \r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n![value proposition with style variable example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad-comparison%402x.png)\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- same audience (control)\r\n- same unique value proposition (control)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- different aesthetic style (variable)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\n<mark>If both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that enough people like your idea, then you've got some validation.</mark> You can stop experimenting if you'd like, or if you want to be more thorough, you can move on to the second test: testing the audience.\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks per impressions than the other, you could be concerned that the unique value proposition isn’t strong enough and that the ads visual style is what garnered the clicks. You should run a UVP A/B test to isolate the style as the enticing factor.\r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks to make you happy, you should run this test again with a different UVP.\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with value proposition variable\r\n\r\nThis test is to help us identify the interest of our unique value proposition. Unlike the solo UPV a/b test, here we are going to pit two UVPs against each other. This test is great to run when you have competing ideas, or when you are not sure which aspect of your idea people are most interested in.\r\n\r\nWhen creating this ad, make sure that the ad is simple and focuses mostly on the unique value proposition.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n![Value proposition with value proposition variable example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jasonramirez/example-facebook-ad-uvp-comparison%402x.png)\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- same audience (control)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- same aesthetic style (control)\r\n- different unique value propositions (variable)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it.\r\n\r\nIf both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you might want to do two things: one - run a solo UPV test with each UVP to see if the style was the draw, or two - pick the UVP that is coupled with the least risky to execute business plan. \r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try three things: pick two completely different UVPs and run this again, try a different UVP and run the solo UVP tests, run this test again with a different audience.\r\n\r\n## Value proposition with audience variable\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this experiment is to determine which audience responds best to the UVP. This experiment is best if you think your UVP is great, but the audiences you have tested thus far, are the wrong audiences. \r\n\r\nThis test should be run only after you have run either the value proposition with style variable or the value proposition with value proposition variable experiment. </mark> You will use the same value proposition and style for both ads, but now you’ll run them on two different audiences. \r\n\r\nIt might seem that you could run only one ad this time, and compare results to the previous experiment, but we would then be creating an experiment with two variables: audience and dates the ad ran. <mark>It is important to note that dates can affect click through rates - holidays, times of the year, days of the week, can all affect click rate. </mark> It is best to have only one variable, so you should run two ads for the most accurate results.\r\n\r\n### Variable and controls\r\n\r\n- different audiences, one should be the same as a previous experiment (variable)\r\n- same time frame & budget (control)\r\n- same aesthetic style from the previous experiment (control)\r\n- same unique value propositions from the previous experiment (control)\r\n\r\n### Analyzing outcomes\r\n\r\nIf one ad got way more clicks than the other, and the number of clicks per impressions makes you feel confident that this audience likes your idea, then you should be good to go. You know that one of your value propositions is good, and you know that an audience responds to it.\r\n\r\nIf both ads get the same amount of clicks per impressions, and that amount of clicks makes you confident that the idea is good and the audience likes it, you should be good to go. You know that more than one audience resonates with your value proposition.\r\n\r\nIf neither ad gets enough clicks per impressions to make you happy, you could try two things: pick a completely different UVP and run this again or pick a different UVP and run the UVP test.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThe Facebook ad experiment is a great place to start to build confidence that your idea is resonating with a larger group of people. It is by no means perfect, but it is a good tool for de-risking your product idea up front. Remember, the biggest resource you have is your own time. Be sure to take steps up front to understand if your product can be successful. \r\n\r\n\r\n	t	2017-07-10 10:36:00	2017-09-11 16:47:04.477352	2023-07-14 18:02:28.613096	Validation with Facebook Ads	validation-with-facebook-ads		\N
14	Kill, Pivot or Preserve	==Running out of money or time can force a product team into making difficult decisions about the future of their product. The two most challenging decisions: [pivot](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/ways-to-pivot-a-product) the product or kill it altogether.== To be presented with a challenging decision like this isn't rare; it might happen many times during the life of a product.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest stages of a product, when the risk of running out of resources is greatest, it's important to be very critical of your path and ask yourself if you should kill, pivot or persevere every couple weeks. Typically, the first time you encounter this question, you will rely on the qualitative data from customer development. As your product grows, and you have more users, you can rely on both qualitative and quantitative data such as [pirate metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version).\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to always preserve, but it isn't always the best decision. ==A product is most successful when it can be looked at critically, and changes are made based on what has been learned.== Taking the time to think about the successes and failures of your product and your limited resources, will keep you thinking about your customer and priority.\r\n\r\n## When to Kill\r\n\r\nThe hardest decisions to make about your product is to kill it. I would love to say that a product should be killed when the team has tried everything without success, but that isn't the case. Resources will run out before you can try everything. ==If you can save your resources for a project that has more promise, you probably should.==\r\n\r\nA few questions you can ask yourself before you decide to kill the project:\r\n\r\n* Do you have a continued passion for your product or vision?\r\n* Can you identify exactly why your product is failing?\r\n* Will more than 50% of your customers be "very disappointed" if you kill your product?\r\n* Are there seeing signs of success in the future?\r\n* Are there obvious pivot options that you haven't tried?\r\n* Do you have enough runway (time, money, resources) to try a pivot?\r\n* Will you be devastated if you kill your product?\r\n\r\nIf you answered **no** to more than one of those questions, this product may be ready for the shelf. But obviously, even if you did answer all of those questions with a no, you might be able to justify continuing on. Don't let a stinkin' blog post sink your ship ;) \r\n\r\n## When to Pivot\r\n\r\nThere are many types of pivots that you can make if your product isn't succeeding. Assuming that you are not feeling enough success to continue on the same path, here are some questions you can ask yourself before deciding to pivot:\r\n\r\n* Are there particular parts of your product that are being used far more than others?\r\n* Are customers complaining that your product is too specific?\r\n* Is there a particular customer segment that has responded better than others?\r\n* Are there new channels to your customers that you haven't tried?\r\n* Have you tried changing the pricing? The way you are selling your product? I.e. subscription, a la carte, etc?\r\n* Have you tried focusing on different growth model? Paid, viral, referral etc?\r\n\r\n## When to Preserve \r\n\r\nIt is easy to choose to preserve, but it isn't always the right answer. Before you decide that you don't need to make any major changes to your products path, try asking yourself a few questions:\r\n\r\n* Do you still have a passion for the vision of the product?\r\n* Is the product currently meeting your goals?\r\n* Is the product sustainable at this pace?\r\n* If the product continues at this pace, will it exceed your goals?\r\n* Do you have to defend the product to anyone on your team? \r\n* Do you feel like you have put too much into the product to give up?[IKEA effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect)\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Decision Meeting\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of a product, I like to run a kill, pivot or preserve meeting every 2 weeks. This is when the product is at the greatest risk of running out of money, time or resources. The meeting generally involves the presenter, the stakeholders and anyone that can help to answer questions about the data in the presentation. ==The presenter, often the founder, presents a quick summary of the last 2 weeks, then makes a recommendation to the stakeholders to kill, pivot or preserve. The stakeholders often ask questions, and then vote for or against the recommendation.== Often, you get a consensus, but if that isn't possible, you follow the majority vote or the stakeholder with the largest stake.\r\n\r\n### The Agenda\r\n\r\n* Review the vision of the product.\r\n* Review the goals for the last 2 weeks.\r\n* Talk about what was achieved, and what was learned.\r\n* Present the decision about what to do next, and how the learnings have informed this decision and what steps you will take.\r\n* Vote on it.\r\n\r\n### The Presentation\r\n\r\nI usually create the presentation the day before or day of the meeting. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes to create. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be clear and consistent. It is a great tool to look back and see what you have tried and what you have learned.\r\n\r\nThe presentations can be difficult to compile. When I sit down to start creating the presentation, I often think to myself "what did we do the last 2 weeks?" ==As I begin to prepare the presentation I am almost always wowed by what we have learned and accomplished.== My presentations are anywhere from 5 - 10 pages, and take about 10 minutes to present.  A decision meeting presentation might include:\r\n\r\n* Reminder of the vision of our product.\r\n* Brief summary of what was accomplished in the last 2 weeks.\r\n* Overview of the [meaningful metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version) if you are far enough along.\r\n* Successes and failures, and what we learned from them.\r\n* List of assumptions that have been tested, and if they were validated or invalidated.\r\n* Brief summary of the budget, burn and runway.\r\n* The decision to kill, pivot or preserve.\r\n* A rough plan for the next 2 weeks\r\n\r\nA decision meeting can provide a lot of value. You are setting a tone of transparency. Sharing exciting findings and demonstrating progress. Uncovering new learnings and explaining the direction of the product. Celebrating successes, and illuminating failures as an opportunity to learn. ==Finally, you are keeping the team and stakeholders in the loop and vested and interested in the product.==	t	2017-04-10 14:11:00	2017-04-02 14:11:17.603321	2023-07-14 18:02:40.456046	Kill, Pivot or Preserve	kill-pivot-or-preserve		\N
13	Running a Lean Experiment	If you are building an app with limited time and money, experiments are a necessity. ==It is invaluable to learn what works, and what doesn't, before you invest time and money into an idea.==\r\n\r\nIt's true that some people get it correct the first time. But, that is  rare and risky to assume that you got it correct too. Running experiments helps you gain confidence that you are creating a _correct_ solution.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I will outline the components of a Lean experiment. ==I use Lean experiments because they emphasize spending the least amount of time to build a testable solution.==\r\n\r\n## Setting Up a Lean Experiment\r\n\r\nA Lean experiment follows a straightforward path: \r\n\r\n* Establish your riskiest assumption\r\n* Identify the customer behavior associated with that assumption\r\n* Commit to a single metric you believe in\r\n* Design a solution\r\n* Capture your hypothesis\r\n* Build the minimum viable feature/product\r\n* Document the results\r\n* Record your observations\r\n* Add your insights\r\n\r\nLet's go more into detail about each part of a Lean experiment.\r\n\r\n### [Identify the Riskiest Assumption](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-assumption)\r\n\r\nThe riskiest assumption is an assumption you are making about a key-stone element of your product. You accept it as true without evidence. ==It can take form as a belief about your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about market size, and many other things.==  It is best to start with the riskiest assumptions first.  If we don't address this assumption, this business idea might fail. \r\n\r\nThe riskiest assumption is not easy to find [1]. When trying to find your riskiest assumption, start with universal risks. Be sure to use your intuition and challenge your own assumptions. Follow up by talking with domain experts.\r\n\r\n### [The Customer's Action](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-action)\r\n\r\nHow does your riskiest assumption relate to your customer’s actions? \r\n\r\nLet’s pretend that your riskiest assumption is "customers will trust your service with their personal information". The related **action** is the customer giving you their personal information. \r\n\r\nWhen creating a Lean experiment, you want to identify an action that you can test and measure. Some examples:\r\n\r\n* Choses option a over b\r\n* Pays you for the product\r\n* Signs up for a newsletter\r\n* Comes back to the application the next day\r\n* Refers a friend\r\n\r\nThe best types of actions are real “currency” exchanges. This is when a person give you something of value to them. It demonstrates a high level of honesty in their action. ==The more currency that the person has to spend to complete this action, the more value we can associate with that action.==\r\n\r\n### Target Metric\r\n\r\nCommit to a minimum success threshold. Choose a number high enough to get you and your team excited if true and relative to the assumption you are testing.\r\n\r\n### Experiment\r\n\r\nBuild the absolute minimum required to test your assumption, as fast as possible. Don’t just confirm, learn. Include ways to capture surprises as well as real behavior important to validating your business activity is successful in influencing customer behavior.\r\n\r\n### [Hypothesis](http://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-hypothesis)\r\n\r\nA specific description of the customer behavior you’re measuring, your target metric and the experiment you’re running to test your assumption. If we do X, then Y% of customers will behave in way Z.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened? Record the actual metrics generated during your experiment, paying close attention to new behaviors and surprises. For example, 50% (5/10) people behaved in way Z.\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n\r\nWhy did the customer behave this way? Record the observable behavior, live feedback and reactions you witnessed firsthand, which influenced the actual results.\r\n\r\n### Insights\r\n\r\nInsights change the way you think about your customers or your idea. Record the new information you generated during this experiment, as well as unique observations made in the field.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nWas your riskiest assumption true? Look for a trend in your evidence over time. No single experiment holds all the answers. Iterate? Persevere? Pivot? \r\n\r\nIf you are running many experiments it can be a good idea to create a visual map of those experiments so your team can be aware of the progress you are making [2].\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nRemember, there is no perfect solution, but there are certainly ones that are better than others. Don't assume that you got it right. Assume that you don't know, but the people using your application will tell and show you what "right" feels like. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Endnotes\r\n\r\n- [1] https://leanstack.com/on-identifying-riskiest-assumptions/\r\n- [2] http://www.movestheneedle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rapid_Experiment_Map.pdf	t	2017-04-02 13:53:00	2017-04-02 14:09:19.448116	2023-07-14 18:02:53.805307		running-an-experiment		\N
23	Better Meetings	Meeting fatigue is a common issue in this Virtual First world we work in. There are loads of reasons that video meetings feel taxing. What stood out to me is the actual effect that back-to-back video meetings has on your brain. Some recent research done by [Zoom and Microsoft brought to light that back-to- back video meetings has a negative effect on the brain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2021/04/20/our-brains-need-breaks-from-virtual-meetings/?sh=4b7d38fd21e9). After about 60 minutes of constant video chatting, the brain starts to react as if it’s under stress. \r\n \r\n## Solution\r\nAccording to the research, taking 10 minute breaks between Zoom meetings has the very positive result of keeping your brain out of the stress zone. We’ve known breaks are good, but it’s not always easy to take them. My plan is simple — create a meeting culture that prioritizes breaks.\r\n\r\n## Principles\r\n### Start meetings late. \r\nWhen we end meetings early it’s easy to run over time. However people rarely show up early if you start them late.\r\n\r\n### Meetings should be short. \r\nIf you have 30 minutes, you’ll take 30 minutes. By constraining the duration of the meeting, you can improve the focus. You can have more productive meetings, enforce agendas, and demand decisions.\r\n\r\n## Executing\r\nIf you create a meeting using the principles above, the result should be: \r\n\r\n- 20 minute meetings start at :10 or :40 after.\r\n- 40 minute meetings start at :20 after.\r\n- No 30 or 60 minute meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Wrap-Up\r\nMeeting fatigue is a real issue in today's virtual work environment. Back-to-back video meetings have been found to have a negative effect on the brain, causing stress and burnout. However, by taking 10-minute breaks between meetings, we can keep our brains out of the stress zone and increase productivity. \r\n\r\nTo create a meeting culture that prioritizes breaks, <b>start meetings late and keep them short.</b>. By doing so, you can focus on the quality of the meeting and more easily enforce agendas and decisions. We can have more productive and efficient meetings while reducing meeting fatigue and improving our overall work performance.	t	2021-11-05 12:00:00	2023-05-11 17:12:54.095283	2023-05-31 14:08:16.557519	Better meetings in a virtual first world	better-meetings		\N
24	Product Design Responsibilities	There are three parts of interaction with AI that we, as product designers, should be designing for: <mark>the input, the output, and the reward</mark>.\r\n\r\n<strong>The input</strong> &mdash; the information a user is sending to the machine.\r\n\r\n<strong>The output</strong> &mdash; the response from the machine to the user.\r\n\r\n<strong>The reward</strong> &mdash; a second input the user sends to the machine in response to the output.\r\n\r\nThere are <strong>overt</strong> inputs and rewards, as well as <strong>hidden</strong> inputs and rewards. Overt inputs and rewards are when the user knows they are feeding the machine to get an output. Hidden inputs and rewards are tracked behaviors that feed the machine that the user is not deliberately sending to it.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the use case will inform how we design the interactions with inputs, digest the outputs, and respond with rewards.\r\n\r\nLet's break down [ChatGPT's chat](https://chat.openai.com) design as an example of how the design suits the use case well. The true use case of ChatGPT chat is to learn how people interact with a conversational A.I and train the ChatGPT language model. The input: a user types in an open text field with almost no guidance. The output: after sending a message, the user gets a text response. The reward: the user can copy the output, give a thumbs up or down, respond to the output with a new prompt, ask ChatGPT to regenerate the output, or leave. The design is great for the use case &mdash; it's designed to learn how people interact with a conversational AI and train the AI.\r\n\r\nLet's explore a hypothetical example and discuss how we might design just the input. Lets's say our use case is to "find the best restaurant near me". The input could be a text box asking the user to write "find the best restaurant near my zip code 10001". Alternatively, we could provide a user with a text box with suggestions on how to talk to the AI, and have a hidden input which knows their location. Or, we could provide a list of options of favorite foods to build out a pallet, have a hidden input for the location, and send the pallet as part of the prompt? Heck, maybe our input is asking that the user uploads a few photos of dishes from previous dining experiences they loved, and a hidden input of their location.\r\n\r\nThe point is, there are numerous ways to design even just the input. This isn't new, but with AI language models being more powerful, we have an exciting opportunity to build transparent, valuable and joyful experiences. \r\n\r\nHave fun designing!\r\n\r\n😃	f	2023-05-17 14:42:00	2023-05-17 14:43:28.996089	2023-05-31 14:07:54.918794	Where do the responsibilities of a product designer begin and end.	product-design-responsibilities		\N
11	Flow & Design Elements	Simply put, "flow" is a highly focused mental state.  It is a level of engagement so concentrated, you don't realize that time has passed until you are out of your flow state. Mikhaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who coined the term, writes about "flow" in his book _Flow_ - first published in 1990. \r\n\r\nCsikszentmihalyi outlines the qualifications a flow state, and the conditions needed to create one. While I was reading it, it dawned on me how many conditions of flow are baked-in to good design. I am writing a more in depth post about designing for flow, but in the meantime, this post lists the qualifications and conditions of flow to consider when designing.\r\n\r\n## Qualifications\r\n\r\nTo experience flow, means you experience:\r\n\r\n*  Intense and focused concentration on the present moment\r\n* Merging of action and awareness\r\n* A loss of reflective self-consciousness\r\n* A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity\r\n* A distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered\r\n* The activity as intrinsically rewarding\r\n\r\n## Conditions\r\n\r\nTo create a flow state, we want to look at the conditions of flow:\r\n\r\n* High perceived challenges\r\n* High perceived skills\r\n* Knowing what to do\r\n* Knowing how to do it\r\n* Knowing how well you are doing\r\n* Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved)\r\n* Freedom from distractions\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nOwen Schaffer, a user researcher and so much more, came up with a questionnaire we can use to understand if the person using our application is in a flow state:\r\n\r\n#### How much of the time did you know?\r\n\r\n|  | Never | Half the time | Always |\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n| What to do next |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| How to do what you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| How well you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| Where to go next |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n\r\n#### How much did you feel?\r\n\r\n|  | Not at all | Somewhat | Very much |\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n| How challenging did this activity feel |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| You could overcome the challenges you faced |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n| You were distracted from what you were doing |&#9675;|&#9675;|&#9675;|\r\n\r\n#### Scoring\r\n\r\nReverse the score of the last question to get Freedom from Distractions. The items above are in the following order: Clear What to Do, Clear How to Do it, Clear How Well Doing, Clear Where to Go, Challenge, Skill, and Freedom from Distractions.\r\n\r\n## Moving On\r\n\r\nThe next time you are thinking about designing a user experience, try to think about the qualifications and conditions of flow. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### References:\r\n\r\n- [Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491137281&sr=8-1&keywords=flow)\r\n- [Crafting Fun Experiences: A Method to Facilitate Flow](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/courses/imgd5100/papers/FlowQuestionnaire.pdf)\r\n- [Flow Questionnaire](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/courses/imgd5100/papers/FlowQuestionnaire.pdf#19)\r\n- [The 8 Elements of Flow](http://www.flowskills.com/the-8-elements-of-flow.html)\r\n	t	2017-03-03 12:05:00	2017-03-30 12:07:25.6976	2023-05-31 17:32:34.706013		flow-design-elements		\N
1	Fixed Position Bug on iOS	The `fixed` value for the `position` property has a very noticeable glitch in\r\niOS9 and perhaps many other versions. ==When scrolling vertically the\r\n`fixed` elements can take a different position than intended.== A fixed header\r\ncould settle 5 to 10 pixels from the top, or a footer might get cut off.\r\n\r\nWe can fix it by establishing the height and width of the `body` and\r\n`html` and setting the `overflow` to auto and\r\n`webkit-overflow-scrolling` to touch.\r\n\r\n## Fix:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\nbody,\r\nhtml {\r\n  height: 100vh;\r\n  overflow: auto;\r\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\r\n  width: 100vw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n==This prevents the browser's menubar from retracting which allows for the fixed\r\nelements to take their intended position.== It does improve the\r\nscrolling experience, but it also leaves us with an omnipresent menubar.\r\n	t	2016-07-07 13:06:00	2016-07-20 13:07:48.422863	2023-07-14 18:05:30.524089		fixed-position-bug-on-ios		\N
27	Manager or Individual Contributor 	Are you questioning which track to take as a Product Designer - Manager or Individual Contributor (IC)? Are you managing someone who is questioning which track to take? Throughout my career, I've had to make this decision personally, as well as work with colleagues that were making this decision. I've tried to support mentees, reports, and colleagues, and let me tell you, the context surrounding the decision is never the same twice. \r\n\r\nIn an [ADP List](https://adplist.org) mentee session, I was asked for some support with the following situation:\r\n\r\n> [...] I've been working as both a product designer and a design manager. However, the scope of the product I'm working on is too big, and I can't work effectively with my team. As a result, I've had to cancel my 1:1 meetings with my direct reports and can't help them when they need my assistance. This situation is frustrating for me.\r\nI recently discussed this with my manager, and they asked me what my choice would be if the company gave me the opportunity to continue working as a design manager/lead or as an individual contributor/product designer.\r\n\r\nMy goal with in that meeting, and with this post is to provide, two significant pieces of information that might help with thinking through this topic. \r\n\r\n# Do Consider\r\n#### Are you comfortable making decisions that directly affect people's lives?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe role of a manager varies, but one thing is clear: your decisions directly impact people's lives. You decide which projects they'll work on, their salary, and even their employment status.\r\n\r\nOf course being a manager has its joys: helping people develop new skills, setting them up for success, and creating opportunities are just part of the fun. However, being a manager also means making tough decisions and giving feedback.\r\n\r\nA good manager is emotionally available, able to handle difficult situations, resolve conflicts, and address issues face-to-face. If you're uncomfortable telling someone they're not performing well, reassigning them from a beloved project, or in the extreme letting them go, then being a manager may not be for you.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't want to focus solely on the challenges, it's important to recognize that you can't be a good manager if you're not willing to make decisions that directly affect people's lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Do Not Consider\r\n#### Do you love using your technical skills?\r\n\r\nMany people claim that as a manager, you no longer need to use your technical design skills. However, it's not about using the same skills, but rather leveraging your expertise and applying your technical abilities to new areas of responsibility. Don't think of switching tracks as a waste of your acquired skills. If someone tells you that you're wasting your skills, they're only looking at the outcomes you've delivered, not considering your true potential.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if you feel that you lack the technical skills to progress in your current track, take a moment to reflect. Are you experiencing imposter syndrome, lacking motivation, or simply not ready to invest in your career? It's alright if you're not prepared to develop new skills in your current path. \r\n\r\nHowever, if that's the case, now may not be the right time to explore a new track. First, ensure that you understand what is inhibiting your desire to invest in yourself. Simply changing tracks isn't always reliable inspiration. In fact, it can often backfire and further hinder progress, as immediate wins may become even more scarce.\r\n\r\n# Closing\r\nwhether you're deciding between a Manager or Individual Contributor (IC) track or supporting someone in this decision, consider the unique context of each situation. But two things to remember; 1) if you don't want to make decisions that affect people lives directly, don't be a manager, and 2) if you're worried about wasting your technical skills, don't be.\r\n\r\n# 👍\r\n	t	2023-07-10 12:50:00	2023-07-10 12:58:12.331443	2023-07-13 02:12:33.50214	Considering the manager or individual contributor track	manager-or-individual-contributor		\N
2	Syntax Highlighting Markdown in Rails	This post is to help you add syntax highlighting to your markdown in a rails app. I prefer to use [Redcarpet] for markdown processing, and [Rouge] for syntax highlighting. This is a complete ruby solution, I believe its the\r\n[fastest], and somewhat easy to implement.\r\n\r\n## 1. Add the redcarpet Gem\r\nAdd the `redcarpet` gem.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Gemfile\r\n\r\ngem "redcarpet"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Create MarkdownParser Class\r\nCreate a `MarkdownParser` class to handle parsing our markdown.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/markdown_parser.rb\r\n\r\nclass MarkdownParser\r\n  require "redcarpet"\r\n\r\n  def initialize(markdown)\r\n    @markdown = markdown\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def markdown_to_html\r\n    processor.render(@markdown).html_safe\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def processor\r\n    Redcarpet::Markdown.new(renderer, extensions = {})\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def renderer\r\n    Redcarpet::Render::HTML\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Add the rouge-rails Gem\r\nAdd the `rouge-rails` gem.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Gemfile\r\n\r\ngem "rouge-rails"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Create a RougeRenderer Class\r\nCreate a `RougeRenderer` class to handle syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/rouge_renderer.rb\r\n\r\nclass RougeRenderer < Redcarpet::Render::HTML\r\n  require "rouge"\r\n  require "rouge/plugins/redcarpet"\r\n\r\n  include Rouge::Plugins::Redcarpet\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Use RougeRenderer to Render\r\nUse the `RougeRenderer` class as the Redcarpet markdown renderer.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/markdown_parser.rb\r\n\r\nclass MarkdownParser\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  def renderer\r\n    RougeRenderer.new(render_options = {})\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6. Set Stylesheets\r\nThere are a couple of ways to add the code styles to you rails app. I like to use the rouge `rougify` CLI command to generate a stylesheet.  The CLI command should let you generate any theme found in the rouge gem's [themes](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/tree/master/lib/rouge/themes).\r\n\r\nFor example, to generate a github stylesheet:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ rougify style github > app/assets/stylesheets/github.css\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add it to your `application.scss` file.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss\r\n\r\n@import "github";\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also copy a stylesheet from [here](https://github.com/jacobsimeon/rouge-rails/tree/master/app/assets/stylesheets/rouge), but be aware of how the classes are scoped. You will have to set up Rogue to handle themes.\r\n\r\n## 7. Use It\r\nYou can pass the markdown parser a file:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n# app/views/some_view.html.erb\r\n\r\n<% file = File.read("path/to/file.md") %>\r\n<%= MarkdownParser.new(file).markdown_to_html %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can directly pass text to the markdown parser:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n# app/views/some_view.html.erb\r\n\r\n<%= MarkdownParser.new("#heading ```code {} ```").markdown_to_html %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Resources:\r\n- [Redcarpet Gem](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet)\r\n- [Rouge Rails Gem](https://github.com/jacobsimeon/rouge-rails)\r\n- [Markdown Processing in Ruby, by Jesse Herrick](https://www.sitepoint.com/markdown-processing-ruby/)\r\n- [Code Stylesheets from @jacobsimeon](https://github.com/jacobsimeon/rouge-rails/tree/master/app/assets/stylesheets/rouge)	t	2016-07-08 13:33:00	2016-07-20 13:33:56.962671	2023-07-12 17:59:02.152501	Add syntax highlighting to your markdown in a rails app	syntax-highlighting-markdown-in-rails		\N
21	Ways To Pivot A Product	If you've hit a point in your product when progress or growth has halted and the current path forward is no longer working, perhaps it's time for a pivot. As Eric Reis put it "a pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision."\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of pivots. Some, such as a marketing pivot or channel pivot, don't involve changing your product. Others can be as drastic as stripping away all the things that aren't working, and zooming-in on only the most important feature. Here is a short list of some different pivots to get your brain flowing:\r\n\r\n><mark>A pivot is a change in strategy, without a change in vision.</mark>\r\n\r\n><small>Eric Reis</small>\r\n\r\n# Customer need pivot\r\n\r\nIn some cases, early on your customers might show little interest in the problem you are solving. This pivot is about rethinking the value of the problem you are solving. Perhaps it's time to solve a different problem with a completely new product. \r\n\r\nOne of the most popular customer need pivots is Groupon. You've probably never heard of the website "The Point": a social good fundraising site that employed the _tipping point system_ to secure funding. When enough people promised a pledge, the funding would be secured - kind of like Kickstarter. It didn't catch on. The founder decided to pivot to a different customer need using the same concept of the _tipping point_. The Point became Groupon. A site where groups of people could hit a tipping point that would open up coupons for use. \r\n\r\n# Zoom-in pivot\r\n\r\nDo you have at least one great feature? Take only the most successful feature (most used? highest grossing?) and strip away anything that isn't necessary for the success of that feature. Double-down on what has been working well, rather than trying to expand into new areas.\r\n\r\nNokia began as a paper mill in 1865. As the company grew, they expanded what they produced, including rubber goods, electronics, and telecommunications devices. In 1992, they zoomed-in and decided to focus exclusively on their mobile devices. They sold off all other divisions of their company and rose to great success (albeit unmaintainable...) \r\n\r\n# Zoom-out pivot\r\n\r\nIf you have an extremely focused product and simple feature set, perhaps it's time to think about expanding into new areas and solving other problems. Dig into your customer and see if they are using your product as a compliment to other software or tools. If so, think about solving for some of the problems that those other tools solve.\r\n\r\nA great example of the zoom-out pivot is PayPal. PayPal started specifically to allow people to beam payments over handheld PDAs. It took a lot of permutations, and the merger with a financial services company, before PayPal became a payments platform. Quickly thereafter, they became the preferred online payment system for eBay and rose to glory.\r\n\r\n# Customer segment pivot\r\n\r\nPerhaps your product solves an actual problem, but the customers who you've been targeting don't appreciate it the way you'd hoped they would. Was there another audience that hinted at the value of your product, but it wasn't for them? Perhaps now is a good time to try and position and optimize your product for a more appreciative segment.\r\n\r\n# Business model pivot\r\n\r\nYour product may not be the problem. Perhaps your pricing model and monetization strategy are inhibiting your product from being more successful. A business model pivot is about altering your pricing model, monetization strategy, and marketing strategy to capture the most value. \r\n\r\nHave fun pivoting ;)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonnazar/2013/10/08/14-famous-business-pivots/#4631e34e5797\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC_IG-EZQUY\r\n- http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\r\n- http://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4\r\n- https://www.fastcompany.com/3001984/pinterest-pivot	t	2017-08-02 21:45:00	2017-09-19 18:45:37.227208	2023-07-12 18:50:22.978948	Ways To Pivot A Product	ways-to-pivot-a-product		\N
20	The IKEA Effect	As a Designer and Product Consultant, one of the most common traits I see in product teams is an unwillingness to throw away the things they've made. Some of the teams I've worked with celebrate removing lines of code, but ==more often then not, people believe that what they made is too valuable to throw away== (even if it can be brought back using Github, [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) or the myriad other forms of version control.)\r\n\r\nThe feeling of sunk costs comes in many forms: you might care what others think of you or that you'll regret quitting because you might be on to something. What I encounter most often is a team that feels their work is too valuable to toss. ==This is known as the IKEA effect: labor equals valuation.==\r\n\r\nThe IKEA effect was coined by Michael I. Norton a, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely after conducting a study on how labor affects valuation. They captured their findings in the paper [The IKEA Effect: When Labor Meets Love](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20mochon%20ariely.pdf). \r\n\r\nThe researchers set up four studies in which they had the participants assemble IKEA boxes, fold origami, and put together sets of Legos. The researchers found that participants viewed their amateur creations to have equal value to that of an expert's creation. Moreover, they expected others would feel the same. \r\n\r\n> <mark>Participants saw their amateurish creations as similar in value to experts' creations and expected others to share their opinions.</mark>\r\n\r\n> <small>Michael I.Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely</small>\r\n\r\nHowever, if the participants were asked to destroy their creation as part of the task, or failed to complete the assembly, the feeling of value was gone. The conclusion was that labor leads to love when labor results in successful completion of tasks, and that labor increases valuation for both “do-it-yourselfers” and novices.\r\n\r\nIf you're ever on the fence about tossing a feature or throwing out some code, ask yourself if you see value in it because you built it. Don't let sunk costs sink you (sorry for that closing bit).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Sources:\r\n\r\n- http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740811000829	t	2017-09-18 19:00:00	2017-09-18 17:01:20.082224	2023-07-14 17:59:10.539672	Not Knowing When to Quit: The IKEA Effect	the-ikea-effect		\N
31	Improving Solution Value	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, a couple of our solutions in emerging spaces had fallen flat. One of the riskiest bets, a time-tracking feature, absorbed design energy but failed to resonate. As a manager, my responsibility wasn’t just to help ship better solutions—it was also to help my designers grow. That meant taking a closer look at why our work was missing the mark, and how we could adjust.  \n\n## Diagnosing What Went Wrong\nWhat I found was simple, but telling. Designers were moving fast, but at the expense of value validation. They focused on polishing user experience while skipping over the deeper question: *was this even worth building?* The investment was measured only in design time, not in business or customer impact.  \n\n## A Framework for Change\nTo course-correct, I leaned on a familiar framework: diagnosis, principles, actions. The diagnosis was clear—we were skipping the hard work of testing for value. The principles I introduced were designed to shift our mindset: scope to impact, show your work so others can give feedback early, and break things down before running too far ahead. The actions followed naturally: assess the risk level of each project, align on the design time required, document and share the design process, and validate value for medium-to-large efforts before committing.  \n\n## Putting It Into Practice\nOne designer translated these principles into “plans of action,” lightweight but transparent documents that showed how design work would unfold. This transparency invited PMs and stakeholders in earlier and built accountability across the team. Another designer led “concept testing,” structured sessions to validate value before investing in execution. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, feedback came in earlier, and concept testing became a staple in critiques.  \n\n## The Shift We Saw\nThe results were immediate. Riskier projects were tested for value upfront, leading to early pivots instead of late scrambles. Loosely defined problems sharpened into specific needs—“time tracking” reframed as “help me get paid,” which ultimately became “create me an invoice.” PMs started engaging more deeply in the design process, and designers themselves began sharing new methods, turning these initial fixes into cultural habits. Our solutions became smaller, more validated, and far less risky.  \n\n> “By slowing down just enough to validate value, we actually sped up the path to solutions that mattered.”  \n\n## What I Took Away\nLooking back, I realized that frameworks give teams clarity, transparency builds accountability, and testing for value must come before polishing design. Most importantly, leadership wasn’t about having all the answers. It was about creating the conditions for the team to ask the right questions—and follow them to better outcomes.  \n\n	t	2023-09-16 00:00:00	2025-09-01 02:59:11.608551	2025-09-01 14:23:15.489457	Back in 2022 at Dropbox, a few of our early solutions fell flat—one of them was time tracking. Designers were moving fast, but they were skipping the hardest question: was this even valuable? I introduced a simple framework—diagnosis, principles, actions—and we built new habits like sharing transparent “plans of action” and running concept tests before investing too deeply. The shift was huge. Vague problems like “time tracking” turned into sharper needs like invoicing, and PMs got more engaged in the process. The lesson for me was clear: when you slow down just enough to validate value, you actually speed up the path to solutions that matter.	improving-solution-value		\N
12	Styling a Rails App in the Browser	As much as I love Sketh, Figma and other tools for creating interfaces, sometime designing in the browser is best. Once I have established a general layout, I like to use the browser for tweaking styles and component placement. \r\n\r\nI have no hard-and-fast rule about when to make the transition from a design tool to the browser, other than when I feel like I am making a lot of minor adjustments to my design file. At that point, it usually means that I am generally happy with the design and it's time to get a little more nitty gritty and try things out. This is also great when you aren't starting a design from scratch, rather iteration to optimize, or perhaps adding a new feature. \r\n\r\nThe most cumbersome thing about designing in the browser is the tools that are available to work with. You either write the CSS locally and refresh the browser, or fidget with the browser tools to see what you like then copy that over to your CSS. \r\n\r\nHowever, with [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) you can write CSS as you normally would; in your text editor. When you save the file, the browser reflects the changes you made without you having to refresh the page. \r\n\r\n## Installing the gem\r\n\r\nWe only want Guard to be operating in our development environment. We will use:\r\n\r\n- [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)\r\n- [Guard Livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#Gemfile\r\n\r\ngroup :development do\r\n  [...]\r\n  gem "guard"\r\n  gem "guard-livereload", require: false\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall the gem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setting up Guard\r\n\r\nSetup guard by adding a Guard definition to our Guardfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ guard init livereload\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setting up the browser\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways to get Guard working in the browser; a browser extension, or middleware. I prefer using middleware, as it keeps all Guard related changes in the codebase.\r\n\r\nI use [rack-liverload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload). Again, we only want this when we are developing, so we scope it to our development environment. Let's set it up:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#Gemfile\r\n\r\ngroup :development do\r\n  [...]\r\n  gem "guard"\r\n  gem "guard-livereload", require: false\r\n  gem "rack-livereload"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure to install the gem, and then restart your server ;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, let's add the middleware to our Rails middleware stack:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#config/environments/development.rb\r\n\r\nMyApp::Application.configure do\r\n  # ...\r\n  config.middleware.insert_after ActionDispatch::Static, Rack::LiveReload\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using\r\n\r\nNow that you are ready to start designing in the browser, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle exec guard\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, Guard will watch all files from `/` on up. When you make an edit and save it, Guard will reload your browser with the new files. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n	t	2017-02-04 13:04:00	2017-04-01 13:05:26.269597	2023-07-14 18:03:35.401125	Styling a Rails App in the Browser	styling-a-rails-app-in-the-browser		\N
5	The Hypothesis	The guiding light to a good experiment is the hypothesis. It is the second\r\nstep to setting up an experiment, right after establishing your risky\r\nassumption.  ==If you can't articulate a hypothesis, then you don't\r\nhave an experiment.==\r\n\r\n==The most straightforward and clear way to write a hypothesis is the\r\n_if_ / _then_ format.== Let's break it down.\r\n\r\n## The "If"\r\n\r\n==The **if** is an isolated change in the application that will lead to\r\na desired behavior or outcome and should be coupled with your\r\nassumption.==  It can be as simple as better feedback, or as complex as\r\nadding a feature. I try to write these as solutions. From there, you should be\r\nable to infer the desire or needs of the user - or better yet, a problem they\r\nare facing.\r\n\r\nGood examples:\r\n\r\n* If we add a success message after...\r\n* If users can chat with one-another in the application...\r\n* If users can challenge one another...\r\n* If there is transparency in who is rating the products...\r\n\r\nBad examples:\r\n\r\n* If we add hundreds of new products...\r\n* If we make our app responsive and remove the landing page...\r\n\r\n## The "Then"\r\n\r\n==The **then** is focused on our desired behavior or outcome and\r\nshould be measurable.== Avoid desired outcomes that deal with\r\nemotion. Although you _could_ measure how happy a person is, it is generally\r\ndifficult to rely on.\r\n\r\nGood examples:\r\n\r\n* Then we will get more _sign ups_.\r\n* Then users will _share_ the app with each other.\r\n* Then more users will participate in the forum.\r\n\r\nBad examples:\r\n\r\n* Then the users will have more fun.\r\n* Then the users wont be so annoyed.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n==A well written hypothesis should help you understand from a high level how you\r\nare going to add value to the user, and how adding that value is going to\r\nresult in a desired and measurable outcome.==\r\n	t	2016-07-20 13:34:00	2016-07-20 13:34:39.780971	2023-07-14 18:05:01.427101	Setting Up An Experiment: The Hypothesis	the-hypothesis		\N
4	The Assumption	==Identifying assumptions help you de-risk in your product by uncovering what\r\nmight make your product fail and addressing that first.==\r\n\r\n==An assumption is a statement you are making about your product that is\r\naccepted as true without evidence.== An assumption can take form as a belief\r\nabout your audience, a recognition of a business necessity, a projection about\r\nmarket size, and many other things.\r\n\r\nA lean experiment should start with the assumption. ==You will want to\r\nvalidate/invalidate the riskiest assumptions first - the ones that if are\r\ninvalidated, the product might suffer or fail.==\r\n\r\n<a id="questions"></a>\r\n## Prioritizing Assumptions\r\n\r\nPrioritizing assumptions isn't always easy. I find that rating some questions\r\nabout an assumption helps me identify the level of risk associated with it.\r\n==Assign a **2 (for Yes)** a **1 (for Maybe)** and a **0 (for No)**.== The\r\nhighest total is most likely your riskiest assumption.\r\n\r\n* ==Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid?==\r\n* ==Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this?==\r\n* ==Will solving this add immediate business value?==\r\n* ==Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck?==\r\n\r\n## Assumption Example One\r\n\r\nLet's pretend we have a product intended to reduce the energy usage in a\r\nbuilding by pitting tenants against each other in a competition. Our products\r\nallows tenants to see the energy usage of each apartment. The lowest energy\r\nconsumer gets bragging rights. Let's look at two assumptions and score them:\r\n\r\n**Tenants are willing to share their energy usage with their neighbors. [1]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **No / 0**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **No / 0**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **No / 0**\r\n\r\n**Competition will drive change to reduce energy consumption. [7]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **Yes / 2**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **Yes / 2**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **Yes / 2**\r\n\r\nKnowing that competition actually will drive change is by far the most important\r\nidea to validate before moving forward. Without this, we don't have a product.\r\n\r\n## Assumption Example Two\r\n\r\nLet's imagine we are at a later stage with the app where  people are using it,\r\nbut we aren't seeing a significant reduction in energy usage. Let's look at two\r\nassumptions and score them:\r\n\r\n**People don't know how to reduce their energy usage. [4]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **Yes / 2**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **No / 0**\r\n\r\n**People don't understand the metric we use to compare them. [2]**\r\n\r\n* Will my business fail if this is valid/invalid? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will it be expensive to implement a solution/feature for this? **No / 0**\r\n* Will solving this add immediate business value? **Maybe / 1**\r\n* Will validating/invalidating this affect a bottleneck? **No / 0**\r\n\r\nThese two score closely. The main difference is the risk we run of not solving\r\nfor the first assumption. If people don't know how to reduce their energy usage,\r\nthen we can never hit our goal of energy reduction and our product fails.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n==Identifying assumptions help you de-risk in your product.== Its best to test\r\nthe riskiest assumptions first. Prioritizing assumptions is not always easy. I\r\nhave found the rating [these questions](#questions) about an assumption helpful,\r\nbut ==if you don't feel confident that the scoring is accurate enough, I urge\r\nyou to dig deeper until you have the confidence that you have identified the\r\nnext riskiest assumption.==\r\n	t	2016-07-12 13:34:00	2016-07-20 13:34:25.939955	2023-07-14 18:05:17.118768	Setting Up An Experiment: The Assumption	the-assumption		\N

33	Leadership Lessons from Product Design	# Leadership Lessons from Product Design\n\nI'm still figuring this leadership thing out. Every day brings new challenges that make me question whether I'm doing it right. But I've learned a few things along the way—usually the hard way—that might be helpful to share.\n\n## The Coaching Moment (Or How I Stopped Being a Hero)\n\nEarly in my leadership journey, I was terrible at it. I made all the classic mistakes, especially trying to be the hero who swoops in to save the day. When a project hit a roadblock, I'd dive in and solve it myself. My team would watch, learn nothing, and the next time a similar problem arose, they'd still need my help.\n\nI was so focused on being the smartest person in the room that I forgot the point of leadership: helping others grow.\n\nThen came the mobile app redesign that humbled me. Our team was stuck on how to approach a complex user flow. The obvious solutions felt uninspired, and I could see the frustration building. I was about to jump in with my brilliant solution when I caught myself. Instead, I gathered the team and asked: "What if we weren't constrained by our current assumptions? What would this look like if we started completely fresh?"\n\nThe room went quiet. Then slowly, ideas started flowing. One designer suggested we think about the user's emotional journey, not just their task completion. Another proposed we map out the entire experience as a story. Within an hour, we had a completely new approach that was more ambitious and user-centered than anything I would have proposed alone.\n\nI realized I wasn't the hero—I was just asking the right questions. That's when I learned the first principle: **Coach, don't dictate.**\n\n## Setting Strategic Direction (And Failing at It)\n\nBut coaching without direction is like sailing without a compass. I learned this the hard way during a period when I was so focused on empowering my team that I forgot to provide clear strategic guidance.\n\nWe were working on a feature that everyone was excited about, but it wasn't aligned with our company's strategic priorities. I should have seen this coming, but I was too caught up in the excitement of the work. The team poured their hearts into it, only to have it deprioritized at the last minute. The disappointment was palpable, and I realized it was my fault—I hadn't done enough to connect our work to the bigger picture.\n\nI felt like I'd let my team down. That failure taught me that leadership isn't just about empowering people—it's about giving them the context they need to make good decisions.\n\nNow, I always start projects by ensuring everyone understands the "why" behind our work. We don't just design features; we solve business problems and create user value. When the team understands this context, they make better decisions and feel more connected to the impact of their work.\n\n## The Innovation Trap (Where I Got Lost)\n\nThere's a dangerous trap that many design leaders fall into: the belief that every solution must be revolutionary. I certainly fell into it, and I still catch myself there sometimes.\n\nI was presenting a design proposal to our executive team, and I could see their eyes glazing over as I described our "groundbreaking" approach. The problem wasn't that the idea was bad—it was that I was so focused on innovation that I'd lost sight of what the business actually needed.\n\nA wise mentor pulled me aside afterward and said, "Sometimes the most innovative thing you can do is to solve a real problem simply and effectively."\n\nThat conversation humbled me. I realized I was trying to impress people instead of helping them. Now, I encourage my team to explore wild ideas, but I also help them understand when to adapt and align with organizational realities. This isn't about compromising vision—it's about understanding that leadership means knowing when to push boundaries and when to work within them.\n\n## Building Teams That Last (Still Learning)\n\nThe most rewarding part of leadership isn't the individual wins—it's watching your team grow and succeed together. But I've also learned that strong teams aren't built by accident, and I'm still figuring out the best ways to do this.\n\nI've made plenty of mistakes in team building. I've pushed people too hard, not pushed them enough, and sometimes just been oblivious to what they needed. But I've also had moments that reminded me why this work matters.\n\nOne of my proudest moments was watching a junior designer I'd mentored lead a complex project with confidence. She'd started out hesitant to share her ideas, but through coaching and encouragement, she'd developed into someone who could not only execute great design but also inspire others.\n\nI didn't do this alone—she did the hard work. I just created the space for her to grow.\n\n## Navigating the Storms (Where I Feel Most Uncertain)\n\nLeadership isn't always smooth sailing. There are times when you need to guide your team through uncertainty, whether it's a strategic pivot, organizational changes, or just the natural ups and downs of product development.\n\nDuring these moments, I've learned that the most important thing isn't having all the answers—it's being honest about what you know and what you don't, while maintaining a clear vision of where you're headed.\n\nWhen our company went through a major reorganization, I was as uncertain as anyone about what the future held. But I focused on helping my team understand what was changing and what wasn't. We maintained our commitment to great design while adapting to new processes and priorities. The team emerged stronger and more resilient than before.\n\nI'm not sure I handled it perfectly, but we got through it together.\n\n## The Journey Continues (Because I'm Still Learning)\n\nLeadership is a journey, not a destination. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities to grow. The principles I've learned—coaching over dictating, setting clear direction, balancing innovation with pragmatism—aren't just theoretical concepts. They're tools I use every day to help my team do their best work.\n\nBut I'm still learning. I still make mistakes. I still have days where I wonder if I'm doing any of this right.\n\nThe most important lesson? Leadership isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about creating an environment where everyone can be their best selves and do their best work.\n\nAnd that's a lesson I'm still learning every day.	t	2025-09-01 00:00:00	2025-09-01 02:59:11.750222	2025-09-01 13:46:30.900858	\N	leadership-lessons-from-product-design	\N	\N
32	Intersession Engagement Strategy	## The Challenge\n\nAt Grow Therapy, we identified intersession engagement as a critical strategic priority. The therapy experience couldn't just happen once a week in a one-hour session. To deliver better care, support providers, and demonstrate outcomes strong enough to maintain insurance contracts, we had to improve the quality of care that happened between sessions.\n\n## The Solution\n\n### Session Topics Feature\n\nWe designed a system that prompted clients to reflect on their therapy experience before sessions. Key features included:\n\n- **Guided Reflection**: Help clients who struggle with reflection\n- **AI Summarization**: Convert open reflections into actionable topics\n- **Dynamic Prompting**: Contextual timing based on client journey\n- **Provider Preparation**: Clear, concise summaries for therapists\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\nThe solution focused on helping people who don't know how to reflect, rather than just serving those who already had the habit. This required:\n\n- Expanding the problem space beyond simple note-taking\n- Using exploration frameworks to generate divergent ideas\n- Studying competitors and using AI tools for inspiration\n- Validating why reflection was difficult in the first place\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n### Innovation vs. Pragmatism\n\nWe championed audio-first reflection based on evidence from our Summit acquisition, but adapted when the CTO pushed back.

30	Turning Constraints Into Better Outcomes	## The Challenge  \nIn Q3 of 2022, my team at Dropbox faced a daunting project: a new license type called “Flexible Licensing.” The initial estimate was that it would take 12–18 months to complete. Leadership wanted proof it was worth investing that kind of time and energy, but the team saw massive technical risk and leaned toward saying “no.” My job as Design Director was to break that deadlock and find a way to move forward without overcommitting.  \n\n## Resetting Expectations  \nThe turning point came in a meeting with area and group leads where an Engineering Manager and a Product Design Manager argued that the scope was simply too large. I immediately challenged the “no” response. With support from partners, I reframed the problem: don’t block it—scope the risk instead. That shift forced the team to articulate the specific risks and explore possible solutions rather than shutting the project down.  \n\n## Speed as a Strategic Constraint  \nInstead of aiming for perfection, I challenged the team to show what they could validate in just six weeks. Speed became a constraint, not a liability. With that framing, the team identified ways to mitigate risk: launching with a small beta group rather than every platform, using design and communication to set expectations clearly, and focusing only on the most critical functionality.  \n\nAn Engineering Manager stepped up with a scrappy but well-thought-out plan, proving that the concept could move forward with limited investment.  \n\n## What We Delivered  \nThe team shipped an alpha version of Flexible Licensing to a small set of willing adopters. Designers broke the problem into manageable parts, engineers mapped out dependencies we could avoid, and together we delivered something valuable without waiting years. Some platform-specific benefits had to wait, but by narrowing scope, the timeline shrank dramatically.  \n\nThe alpha not only validated the concept but also gave us room to focus on quality where it mattered most. The result was a smaller, sharper, more useful solution that scaled because customers immediately found value in it.  \n\n> “Constraints don’t just speed you up—they can actually make the work better.”  \n\n## Key Lessons  \n1. Challenge assumptions instead of accepting “no.”  \n2. Use constraints strategically—speed can sharpen focus.  \n3. Break complex problems into parts that can be validated.  \n4. Validate value before investing heavily.  \n5. Leverage beta groups to learn fast.  \n6. Quality often emerges from working within limits.  	t	2024-01-15 00:00:00	2025-09-01 02:59:11.489504	2025-09-04 04:35:04.482743	How I used speed as a constraint to turn a year-long licensing project at Dropbox into a scrappy alpha that proved value fast. 	turning-constraints-into-better-outcomes		In 2022 at Dropbox, my team faced a huge project: a new license type that was scoped at more than a year of work. Engineers saw too much risk and wanted to say no. Instead, I reframed the problem—don’t block it, scope the risk. We set speed as a constraint and asked what we could validate in six weeks. The team launched a scrappy alpha to a beta group, proving value without massive investment. The lesson? When you use constraints strategically, you don’t just move faster—you often end up with better quality too.  
68	Validating Value: How We Turned Flat Solutions Into Impactful Ones  	## When Good Work Falls Flat  \nIn Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I was a Design Director overseeing teams working in new areas—freelancer tooling, admin actions—and a few of our solutions weren’t sticking. Some shipped features looked promising at first, but they didn’t make much impact. The riskiest bet was a time-tracking feature. It was polished, but it wasn’t solving anything people really cared about.  \n\n## My Role as Design Director  \nThis was my responsibility. Not to redesign the feature myself, but to help my team figure out why our work wasn’t landing—and to help them build the skills to avoid this trap in the future.  \n\n## The Real Problem  \nWhen I dug in, I realized what was happening. The team was moving fast, which usually I encourage, but in this case speed had a cost. Designers were focusing on user experience details and execution, but skipping the hard part: validating value. We weren’t asking, *is this the right problem?* or *does this solution actually matter?* Effort was being measured in design hours, not in ROI.  \n\n## Resetting with a Framework  \nI knew we needed a reset. I brought the designers together and shared a framework I rely on: diagnosis, principles, actions. We diagnosed the issue—too much energy on polish, not enough on value. We agreed on principles to guide us: scope to impact, show your work so feedback comes early, and break things down instead of going all in on big bets. Then we turned those into actions: identify risk up front, align on design time needed, document the process and share it with partners, and test value on medium- and large-sized projects before going too deep.  \n\n## How the Team Responded  \nThe team ran with it. One designer introduced lightweight “plans of action” that made our design process transparent and invited PMs in earlier. Another led concept testing sessions, bringing early user feedback into critiques before ideas hardened. Suddenly, plans were being shared openly, concept tests were informing direction, and PMs were leaning in with curiosity instead of just waiting for handoffs.  \n\n## What Changed  \nThe shift was dramatic. Riskier projects started getting tested for value before anyone sunk months of work. Vague ideas like “time tracking” sharpened into clear problems like “help me get paid,” and then into focused solutions like “create me an invoice.” Designers weren’t just executing—they were shaping strategy. PMs began engaging more deeply in the design process, and the team itself started adding new process ideas beyond the ones I’d suggested.  \n\nOur solutions got smaller, sharper, and less risky. More importantly, the team gained new habits—plans of action and concept testing—that raised the quality of design work across the board.  \n\n> “When you slow down just enough to validate value, you actually speed up the path to solutions that matter.”  	f	2022-04-02 00:00:00	2025-09-02 14:11:05.293614	2025-09-04 03:50:04.14421	A story about how I helped my team at Dropbox validate value early, turning flat solutions into impactful ones.  	validating-value-how-we-turned-flat-solutions-into-impactful-ones		\N
73	Breaking Out of Incrementalism	## The Challenge  \nWhen I first joined Dropbox, I inherited a small team of three ICs working on Onboarding. They were in the middle of a transition—from acting as a service arm to PM partners toward becoming embedded in squads. The problem was that they weren’t able to get ahead of the work.  \n\nInstead of shaping strategy, they were shipping small optimizations: moving a button here, tweaking a flow there, A/B testing everything. The work was revenue-generating, but the quality and impact of solutions were starting to degrade. Watching this pattern, I realized we were heading in the wrong direction.  \n\n## My Role  \nAs Design Director, it was my responsibility to make sure the solutions were not only good but impactful. I also needed to motivate the team by giving them meaningful problems to solve—not just incremental tasks handed down from PMs.  \n\n## Resetting the Strategy  \nI started by analyzing the reality of the situation: why were we stuck in small optimizations? My conclusion was that the team lacked a clear process to shape bigger opportunities.  \n\nSo I drafted a strategy framework:  \n1. **Draft** → Identify opportunities and outline hypotheses.  \n2. **Align** → Partner with PMs and stakeholders to ensure we were chasing the right goals.  \n3. **Iterate and Refine** → Explore multiple design directions, not just one.  \n4. **Validate** → Run concept testing with users to confirm value early.  \n5. **Execute** → Deliver solutions with confidence that they mattered.  \n\nI socialized this approach with PM partners, showing them how a more strategic design process could still serve business needs while unlocking bigger opportunities.  \n\n## The Results  \nThe shift was significant. By validating ideas earlier and aligning on impact, we moved away from low-leverage optimizations toward more meaningful improvements in onboarding.  \n\nDesigners felt more motivated because they were working on problems that mattered. PMs became more engaged partners, excited to test concepts and understand user value rather than just running button-placement experiments.  \n\nIn short, we traded “moving buttons” for solving real onboarding challenges—and design’s impact grew noticeably.  \n\n> “Small optimizations keep you busy. Validating value makes you impactful.”  \n\n## Key Lessons  \n1. Incremental work is a signal—it shows when process is broken.  \n2. A clear framework creates space for bigger, more strategic solutions.  \n3. Concept testing turns vague opportunities into validated problems.  \n4. Aligning with PMs is critical to shifting from service work to strategic partnership.  \n  	t	2020-02-02 00:00:00	2025-09-04 04:45:13.411587	2025-09-04 04:48:58.184977	How I helped a Dropbox onboarding team break out of incremental work and deliver more impactful solutions.	breaking-out-of-incrementalism		When I joined Dropbox, my onboarding design team was stuck shipping small optimizations—moving buttons, running endless A/B tests. The work generated revenue but the impact was fading. I introduced a simple strategy: draft opportunities, align with PMs, iterate broadly, validate with users, and then execute. That shift helped us break out of incrementalism. Designers worked on problems that mattered, PMs engaged more strategically, and onboarding improvements became bigger, sharper, and more impactful. The lesson? Small optimizations keep you busy, but validating value makes you impactful. 
34	Creating Design Principles That Get Used	Design principles are everywhere. Most design orgs have them, but too often they sit in a Notion doc or slide deck, rarely shaping real decisions. The challenge isn’t just writing principles—it’s creating ones that teams believe in, use, and hold each other accountable to.  \n\n## Why Have Design Principles?\n- Create alignment → Give teams a shared lens for making decisions, reducing subjective debates.\n- Connect design to company ethos → Anchor design choices in the broader mission, not just aesthetics.\n- Raise quality consistently → Define what “good” looks like so the bar isn’t left to interpretation.\n- Accelerate decision-making → Provide a shortcut when trade-offs or conflicts arise.\n- Scale design thinking cross-functionally → Make design values accessible to PMs, engineers, and others, not just designers.\n\n## Start with Listening, Not Writing  \nThe first step isn’t drafting. It’s listening. Before any words go on the page, I’ve found it essential to run a listening tour—surveying designers, PMs, engineers, and researchers about what feels inconsistent in the work. Ask questions like:  \n- Do we feel aligned in how we make design decisions?\n- Do our design choices reflect the company’s values and ethos?\n- Do we have a shared understanding of what “quality” means in our work?\n- Do disagreements in critique or product reviews often feel subjective?\n- Do cross-functional partners understand how design makes decisions?  \n\nPatterns emerge quickly, and they highlight the gaps principles can fill.  \n\n## Involve the Right Stakeholders Early  \nDesign principles aren’t just for designers. If they only live in critique sessions or design documentation, they won’t influence the broader product. That’s why it’s critical to involve cross-functional partners early—PMs, engineering leads, brand design, even executives. Without their buy-in, principles risk becoming “design wallpaper.”  \n\nAt Grow Therapy, we drafted a thoughtful set of principles:  \n\n1. **Prioritize the therapeutic relationship**  \n2. **Support, don’t overshadow**  \n3. **Celebrate growth, big and small**  \n4. **Be inclusive and compassionate by design**  \n\nEach principle came with clear “when done right” and “when done wrong” examples, plus product tie-ins from rescheduling, reviews, and treatment plans. They were grounded in the actual problems we were solving.  \n\nBut here’s the hard truth: they were never adopted.  \n\nWhy? Because I didn’t bring the right stakeholders in early enough. Brand Design wanted to lead, but they were waiting on company-wide principles. Our VP of Product wasn’t engaged early, so alignment never solidified. We ended up in a waiting game, and the staff designer I asked to drive the effort didn’t have clear channels to get feedback and input from those who mattered most.  \n\nThe principles were strong. The process was weak.  \n\n## Choose the Right Owner  \nEvery principle needs a champion, but not a dictator. The right owner is someone who can communicate clearly, bring people along in the process, and keep the focus on collaboration over ego. Low ego, high drive, and strong facilitation skills are the traits to look for. Ownership here is about stewardship—ensuring principles evolve with the team and get used in the day-to-day.  \n\nIf I could go back, I’d have paired the staff designer with a more senior sponsor—someone who had visibility and credibility across leadership—to make sure the right doors got opened.  \n\n> “The process of making design principles is as important as the principles themselves—it’s how you build trust in them.”  \n\n## Build Through Collaboration  \nPrinciples can’t be handed down from on high. Workshops,\n	t	2025-03-11 00:00:00	2025-09-01 02:59:11.81507	2025-09-04 04:34:13.656504	Principles work when the process includes cross-functional buy-in, the right owner to drive them.\n	creating-design-principles-that-get-used		Design principles are everywhere, but too often they just sit in a doc and never influence real work. At Grow Therapy, we drafted a strong set of principles around supporting therapeutic relationships, celebrating growth, and being inclusive by design. But here’s the catch—they were never adopted. I hadn’t brought in key stakeholders early enough, like Brand and our VP of Product, and the staff designer leading the effort didn’t have clear channels for feedback. The result? A waiting game where nothing moved forward. The lesson for me was clear: principles only work when the process includes cross-functional buy-in, the right owner to drive them, and examples that make them real. Otherwise, they don’t make it past the slide deck.
72	Raising the Bar Without Slowing Down 	## The Challenge  \nIn January 2023, our design organization went through a reorg. I was leading design across 4 groups with 12 squads, supported by two managers and two senior architects. 30% of the people had joined Dropbox in the last 6 months.\n\nWhen I stepped back to evaluate the work, I saw issues: experiences below our quality bar, duplicative bespoke patterns, and overly designed solutions. With so many new folks learning unfamiliar surfaces, I knew the problem would only compound. My task was clear: raise the quality of solutions—without slowing the team down.  \n\n## The Approach  \nWe already had processes documented, and our managers were empowered to lead. So I made a conscious choice: instead of micromanaging execution, I would focus specifically on solution quality.  \n\nI aligned with the managers and senior ICs to define a “quality standard” for the team. The philosophy was simple: if leadership is calibrated, we can scale feedback consistently across all squads.  \n\nTo reinforce the standard, we added rituals: critiques followed by leadership calibrations, a living document to capture overlapping experiences and conflicts, and plans of action that made design intent transparent and ROI-driven. We also introduced velocity tracking to ensure that our focus on quality didn’t come at the cost of speed.  \n\n## What Changed  \nThe results came quickly. Teams began to identify quality issues themselves, cutting down on bespoke one-offs and increasing cohesion across experiences. Designers leaned into usability testing, negative feedback dropped, and velocity actually increased.  \n\nPattern cohesion improved, connectivity across experiences strengthened, and the overall quality bar rose noticeably. Most importantly, it wasn’t me alone setting the bar—it was the managers and senior ICs pushing for specific changes and scaling that expectation across their squads.  \n\n> “By aligning leadership on quality, we empowered the whole team to raise the bar—without sacrificing speed.”  \n\n## Key Lessons  \n1. Quality scales when managers and senior ICs are calibrated and trusted to lead.  \n2. Transparency through plans of action surfaces ROI trade-offs early.  \n3. Velocity tracking keeps “quality” from becoming an excuse for slowing down.  \n4. Standards need to be living, reinforced through rituals—not static documents.  \n\n---\n\n**TL;DR (Audio-Ready Script)**  \n\n> \n\n**Navigate-To Button TL;DR**  \n 	t	2023-10-17 00:00:00	2025-09-04 04:36:42.191742	2025-09-04 04:40:11.551941	How I scaled quality across 12 squads at Dropbox by aligning leaders and setting a clear standard. 	raising-the-bar-without-slowing-down		In 2023, after a reorg at Dropbox, I led a design org of 12 squads with 30% new members. Quality was slipping—patterns were inconsistent, and some solutions were overdesigned. I set a clear quality standard with managers and senior ICs, added rituals like leadership calibrations and transparent plans of action, and tracked velocity to make sure we weren’t slowing down. The results were immediate: stronger cohesion, fewer bespoke solutions, more usability testing, and higher velocity. The lesson? Align leaders on quality, and you can raise the bar without sacrificing speed.  
28	Preparing for a Creative Leadership Interview	💡 *So you’ve got a Creative Leadership interview coming up?*  \nCongrats—you’re about to be grilled (nicely) on how you think, not just what you ship.  \n\nA Creative Leadership interview usually focuses on two big things:  \n1. How you set direction and strategy.  \n2. How you manage quality and execution.  \n\nHere are a few common questions you’ll probably face—plus how I’d tackle them using the [STAR](https://www.jasonramirez.com/posts/the-star-method) method:  \n\n- **How have you set, communicated, and evangelized strategy?**  \n  (Tip: Tell a story about a moment when you had to zoom way out, bring people along, and keep everyone aligned when things got messy.)  \n\n- **How do you ensure quality of execution on your design team?**  \n  (Hint: They’re not asking if you like pretty pixels—they want to hear how you empower others, set standards, and keep velocity high.)  \n\n- **How have you identified opportunities, operationalized initiatives, and driven your team toward impact?**  \n  (Yes, it’s a mouthful. Think: spotting a gap, rallying your crew, and shipping something that moved the needle.)  \n\n---\n\n## Closing Thought\n\nWhen you’re in the hot seat, keep it simple:  \n- Be concise.  \n- Use real stories.  \n- Show *how* you got to the outcome, not just the outcome itself.  \n\nMost of all—practice out loud. It feels silly, but when you can tell your stories smoothly, you’ll come across as thoughtful and confident.  \n\nGood luck out there ✨✌️  	f	2023-07-14 00:00:00	2023-07-14 19:36:16.47464	2025-09-04 04:44:12.006686	A quick guide to Creative Leadership interviews: what they cover, common questions, and how to use STAR stories to nail your answers.	preparing-for-a-creative-leadership-interview		Creative Leadership interviews aren’t about outcomes—they’re about how you think and lead. You’ll be asked how you set strategy, ensure execution quality, and spot opportunities. The key is to answer with real STAR stories: be concise, show how you got there, and focus on the process, not just the results. Practice your stories out loud, and you’ll come across clear, confident, and ready to lead.
70	Navigating Conflicting Directives\n	In Q2 of 2022 at Dropbox, I found myself in the middle of a tension that’s common in large organizations: conflicting directives from leadership. My group was focused on collaboration within teams, spanning across the Pro SKU, Business Standard, and Enterprise. At the start of the quarter, my PM partner was advised to divest from Enterprise clients and lean toward short-term revenue. Meanwhile, my boss instructed me to go deeper into Enterprise and invest in a new admin experience. Both perspectives had merit, but they pointed us in opposite directions.  \n\n## Diagnosing the Conflict  \nThe misalignment surfaced in a team leads meeting. My PM partner and I compared notes and realized that what our respective leaders were asking us to prioritize didn’t line up. When we raised this misalignment, stakeholders asked us to demonstrate a feasible path forward rather than just flag the problem.  \n\nDigging deeper, we uncovered a few important dynamics. A senior architect was advocating for the admin opportunity and had the ear of my boss, partly through past backchannel conversations. At the same time, company goals were clearly oriented toward short-term revenue. The disconnect wasn’t just about strategy—it was also about communication breakdowns and a lack of clear roles.  \n\n## Actions to Move Forward  \nThe first step was to repair communication. I sat down with the senior architect and clarified roles and responsibilities: I would remain accountable for strategy, and he would be responsible for execution. That created much-needed clarity.  \n\nNext, I worked with my PM partner to reestablish priority. We were able to align stakeholders on the importance of short-term revenue, but there was no agreement on the right approach. To break the deadlock, I proposed a compromise: give the architect a three-week runway to see if the admin initiative could be broken into smaller pieces that might generate faster revenue. We allocated DS and PMM support for exploration, while also pushing forward with PMs and design leads on expanding paid security features, which had clearer near-term upside.  \n\n## Results and Lessons  \nThe architect ran lightweight concept testing with smaller enterprise clients, partnered with PMM for customer conversations, and collaborated with DS on data exploration. Despite the effort, we didn’t find a credible short-term revenue path. With evidence in hand, we communicated our recommendation to divest from Enterprise and refocus on nearer-term opportunities.  \n\n> “Sometimes leadership isn’t about choosing a side—it’s about creating a path to test both and letting the evidence guide the decision.”  \n\nThis experience reinforced a few lessons for me. First, misalignment often stems from communication gaps as much as from strategy itself. Second, defining clear roles and responsibilities helps build trust and avoids power struggles. And finally, when faced with conflicting directives, creating a structured way to test assumptions not only brings clarity, it helps stakeholders feel heard—even if their preferred path isn’t the one pursued.	t	2022-07-20 00:00:00	2025-09-04 03:52:13.286579	2025-09-04 04:48:34.980618	How I resolved conflicting directives at Dropbox by designing a test that let evidence—not politics—guide the decision.  	navigating-conflicting-directives		
71	Turning a Team Framework Into Company-Wide Impact	## The Challenge  \nIn Q1 of 2021, activation work at Dropbox was inconsistent. My team had developed an effective strategy for helping new users get to value, but outside of our group, the approach wasn’t being used. Other teams were working on their own versions of “new user experience,” but the results weren’t impactful or aligned with the strategy we knew worked. Without adoption beyond our group, our impact was limited.  \n\n## My Role  \nAs a Design Director, my responsibility was to improve the outcomes of design work—not just in my team, but across the company. That meant scaling our activation thinking beyond our walls and creating a foundation others could adopt.  \n\n## Building the Framework  \nThe first step was to codify what worked. I drafted an activation framework that captured the principles behind our success and began socializing it with designers outside my group. To build momentum, I also started an “Onboarding Guild,” a forum where designers could seek advice on building activation solutions.  \n\nAdoption was slow. Even though the framework was clear and rooted in the CCC model, most teams continued to do their own thing. I realized we needed more than documentation—we needed proof.  \n\n## Changing the Evangelization Strategy  \nI asked two teams to apply the framework and capture their results. These case studies became the evidence we needed. With that in hand, I shifted my strategy: instead of sending the framework to individual designers, I started sharing it directly with cross-functional leads. I showcased team wins in relevant forums and in all-function Slack channels, making the framework’s value visible to PMs, engineers, and other stakeholders.  \n\n> “Scaling a strategy across an organization isn’t about telling people what to do—it’s about showing them why it works.”  \n\n## The Impact  \nWith real examples and cross-functional buy-in, adoption spread. Teams that used the framework improved their activation experiences, and over time it became a standard approach across the company. The Onboarding Guild continued under new leadership, carrying the culture forward. The framework didn’t just improve design outcomes—it shaped how Dropbox thought about activation as a whole and even justified investment into a platform for pre-in-product data collection.  	t	2021-05-21 00:00:00	2025-09-04 04:01:29.782585	2025-09-04 04:04:48.435616	How I scaled activation design at Dropbox by turning a team strategy into a company-wide framework.	turning-a-team-framework-into-company-wide-impact		In 2021 at Dropbox, activation efforts were fragmented and inconsistent. My team had a strategy that worked, but it wasn’t being adopted elsewhere. I created an activation framework, socialized it, and launched an onboarding guild, but adoption stayed low until we proved its value with real examples. I shifted the evangelization strategy—sharing wins with cross-functional leads and across the company. Over time, the framework became standard practice, reshaping how Dropbox approached activation and even driving investment into new platforms. The lesson? Scaling impact isn’t about pushing process—it’s about showing results others can’t ignore.
